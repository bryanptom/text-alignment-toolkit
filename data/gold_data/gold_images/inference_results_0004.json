      "raw_text": "Ethel Bruce sat on a low rocker in the recess of the bay windows, apparently in deep thought. A very pretty picture she made. so her Brother Hal thought as he passed along the street in company with Clay Whittlc. Ivies were cropping abov\" and around her head reachiug aiter the sunlight. while lilies, gcraniums, and hv- acintlts were hlooming ai her feet. The gentlemeu passed on. as also did the hands of the clock. but still Ethel sat ia evident study. The room was turn- ished with cultured taste. and skillful hands kept it looking very inviting to the family and their friends. lt was library and sitting room combined. EtheTs parents had always striven to have their home attractive. even if other expenses had to be curtailcd very closely. A The mother was an invalid and had been for several weeks, and the willing hands and thoughtful heart of thc mother were sadly missed by the daughter. The rest of the family said .'that Ethel took moth- er's place to them all so well. that for the time they were not great losers.\" and the mother confined to her room for lack of strength to he elsewhere. rather thcn from actual pain said ..that she was having a rest in mind and body. ior Ethel did not neglect anything\" and she kept the little mother fresh and dainty, and tho room so bright aud cheery. that all the iamily would gather around her in social glee. Ethel would first notice mother's tired look f they stayed too long. and pleasantly chiding them would drive them off to the sitting room. Clay Whittle used often to come in with Hal to the mother's room, and these little visits were seasons of de- ight to him. His mother had passed the portals over into the other side. How he missed her room and her counsel, and thc time spent over at the Bruces. were choice minutes and great helps to him. His father was a leading politician, bis sister a fashionable woman. whilo he him- self was a law student. The evening before Clay and Ethel had attended an entertainment together aud on passing out from t, she stopped moment to speak to a friend and Clay was joined by his sister. Clay she asked \"Why didn't you bring Eva Dryton this evening\"\" \"I prefer the company have.\" he answered. \"Company good enough dare say. but like to see a girl with some style of dress. Everything she wears is a year old.\" \"Which of itself is a crime of the first degree in the fashionable world\" he answered joined Ethel and passed on. So on this the following morning.. Ethel was trying to study out some plans for pew clothes. Of course she was indig- nant over the remark. but it was true that all she had. was a year old, but she had felt that they were good enough. until now. She knew too. that all they had to live upon was her father's salary. which might have seemed large to many, but their expenses were correspondingly large, and with mothers sickness and Tons college bills. or a pat of them. somebody had to economize and really deny them selves, and she had felt willing, and even anxious to do her share but after over- hearing the remark of the night before, denying herself had not been so sweet. She examined the closets to sce if there was anything available to be made over. but returned to her low rocker disheart- ened. Her father came in. and seeing something amiss. asked. \"What are your thoughts like, daughter. and what are your wishes Speak, and if half of the kingdom is desired. it shall be yours!\" \"I thought was queen of the realm, and mistress of all survey. desire no more than the bone kingdom, with a robe of royal purple.\" \"Or some. other fashionable shade\" he said. .Frank ly. Ethel, what were you thinking about?\" \"I was wondering if there was any sur- | plus money in the family treasury, fhat | could use for myself\" she said. \"I think about forty dollars. Would it help you?'' The father seemed to hesitate. Ethel spoke quickly. \"I do not want it if it is needed eleswhere.\" \"IiH let vou know at tea-time,\" he said. \"Will balance accounts for the month. and rest assured, you shall have it. daughter, if father can spare it,\" and seated on one knee with her arm twined around his $neck. she stroked his manly beard, ca- iressinglv. awe are not rich.

Y, Oct. 15.-The dispo- sition of 4,000 acres of land near Marinus, Fla., hinges on the outcome of a suit to determine whether Rastus G. Gage, for merly a well known business man of Mid dleport, this state, unlawfully wedded two women. The land in question was the property of Miss Elizabeth Hawkins, whom Gage married in Florida in 1S73. She died in 1893, and there being no children Gage, ass her husband, inherited the land. Robert G.. Hawkins, a brother of the dead woman, contests this disposition of the property on the ground that the mar- riage of Gage to Elizabeth Hawkins was null and void, it being alleged that Gage had married a Jane Reynolds at Middle- port in the sixties, and that she was alive at the time of the second marriage and lived until about a year ago at Catskill, N. Y. The case has been brought in Florida, and in order to examine witnesses in Ni- agara county Justice of the Peace Thomp- son of Middleport and M. C.

      "raw_text": "SAN FRANCIsCo, Oct. 15.-The trial of Theodore Durant for the murder of Blanche Lamont did not go on yesterday. So many of the jurors are business men and this being collection day the court ad- journed until today. It is likely that the court will take a further adjournment. Attorney Duprey, the leading counsel for the defense, is confined to his bed with rheumatism, and his associates will base this as a reason for continuance for sev- eral days. Although the court is known to be opposed to delays in this trial, it is believed, however, that he will grant the continuance. In that case the trial will not likely be resumed before next Monday. In the meantime Theodore Durant ro- mains in his cell, never leaving it for the customary exercising in the corridors lt is said that he is becoming exceedingly irritable. Since he finished his testimony in Judge Murphy's court the defendant has lost considerable vivacity, and instead of being careless and indifferent he is se- rious and troubled. For the first time since his arrest the medical student seemed impressed with the proper idea of his terrible position. At last it has dawned on him that hes may be convicted, and as he realizes the chain of circumstances against him he has become much depressed. Attorney Dickinson, for Durant, remarked that he thought the defense would be able to put ia the balance of its testimony ina two days or less. Then the prosecution will put its witnesses in rebuttal. District At- torney Barnes says he will handle them rapidly, but Dickinson is preparing to cross question witnesses at length, and on that account it need create no surprise if another week is devoted to the work of taking testimony. Although Captain of Detectives Lees is busily engaged in the trial of Durant for the murder of Blanche Lamont, he is not overlooking the Minnie Williams case, but is still gathering evidence to be used when the trial of that case is begun. Many think that in the event the prisoner is convicted of the killing of Blanche La mont he will not be put on trial for the murder of Minnie Williams. Captair Lees and tho district attorney have mado up their minds, however, to press both cases. Just how soon the second trial will begin has not been determined, as a date for the hearing has not been set.",

      "raw_text": "Informntion Received at Washington by Japanese Minister Regarding the Disap- pearance and Probable Death of the Queen-Korean Legation Think Her Dead. WAsHINGToN, Oct. 15.-Information of the formidable uprising in Korea, result ing in the disappearance and probable death of the queen and the landing of military forces by the United States and European powers has been received by Minister Kurino of Japan from the for eign office at Tokyo It is quite sensa- tional, indicating tho landing of marines by Russia, the United States and probably Great Britain. The latest dispatch to Minister Kurino states that a force of Russian marines, 40 in number, has been landed. Thus far they have confined themselves to guard ing the Russian legation at Seoul. United States marines were landed from the Yorktown to the number of 16. It is believed also that British marines have been landed. Besides rhese the Japanese have a considerable force of soldiers at Seoul, who have been preserving order. The dispatches cone from Tokyo and communicate the substance of dispatches received from General Muira, tho Japanese envoy at Seoul. They are dated from tho 9th to the 10th inst. It appears in these dispatches that the trouble had its incep- tion through the queen's dislike of the newly organized soldiers of Korea. The old soldiers had the primitive equipment of the far east, but with tho progress of Japanese influence in Korea two battal- ions of Korean troops were organized on modern methods. Each battalion num- bered 600 men, armed with modern weap- ons. They were well drilled and ofiicered. nv-s ywr2- m,-- o.N- A1.- When the queen showed her disfavor to ward these new troops, they appealed to the Tai Won Kun, a powerful chief, who has long been at enmity with the queen. He accepted the leadership of the new troops, and at the head of one battalion entered the queen's palace. The native soldiers fled from the palace. The Tokyo dispatches do not state specifically what became of the queen further than that she has disappeared and cannot be located. The officials are inclined to believe, how ever, that the unofficial reports of the queen's death are true. 2he Japanese government the dis patches further state, has acted quickly on the reports and has appointed a com mission to inquire into the facts. In tho meantime it is emphatically denied that the queen's death, if it has occurred, was l Japanese Soshi killed the queen. This is not yet confirmed in the dispatches re ceived here. The officials say that the Soshi are an irresponsible and lawIess class, and that their acts cannot be laid tc the Japanese people or government. General Muira's reports also cover tho work of Japanese troops in preserving or der. These troops were stationed opposite the palace, having secured this point o vantage some time since through the Ko rean government. They took no part ir the attack on the palace, but after it hat occurred, when the native troops wert fleeing and the new battalions were en forcing their success in capturing the pal ace, the Japanese troops aided in prevent ing bloodshed and disorder It is probabl that some deaths occurred during the me lee. Following this came the landing o United States and Russian marines, and as is believed, the landing of the British. Prince Pak LikeIy to Rule Korea. The latest indications are that the Ta Won Kun and the king are in control o affairs at the Korean capital. The kin has been the nominal ruler, but the queel has heretofore been recognized as the rea ruler. The influence of tho king and th Tai Won Kun are distinctly favorable t the Japanese. At the Korean legation no word ha been received from the disturbed capital The officials are much exercised and do no doubt that the queen has met her death although they are not ready to abando hope. In case official confirmation is ro ceived there will be such formal ceremon as is usual on the death of a sovereign The legation will go into mourning, bu there is not likely to be a funeral service although this has been considered as further mark of respect. Recent news from Korea makes Princ Pax, lately prime minister of that cour try, the central figure of interest in Wasl ington. He has been here for the last fev weeks and is impatiently awaiting an e1 pected summons from the members of th progressive party, of which he is the lea( er asking him to return and resume h mission of reforming the government. H is likely to be the future ruler of Korea. a Miss Flag1er's Case.",

      "raw_text": " Beautiful Decorations, Excellent Musi. and a Big Parade-Dedication of th. New Building and Anniversary Bal This Evening. The Oddfellows of Waterbury were not very fortunate in their selection of dag for the observance of the fiftieth ami versary of the introduction of the order in this city, and the dedication of theil beautiful new home. Nature was un- kind and the weather was not all that could have been desired. The visitors came by every train and the committees were very early abroad providing for the comfort of their guests. It was an immense un- dertaking to provide for the thousands who visited the city, but every detail had been arranged to a nicety and the procedings were marked with the best of order. If any of our guests have been overlooked. slghted or treated ungraciously the fault was not of the heart, for Waterbury tried to outdo itself on this occasion, people of all classes co- o-operating with the committeer to make the affair a suc- cess. It is estimated that there are four thousand Oddfellows in the city and  in by train and trolley cars. The fact that it is a legal holiday, created by the late session of the general assembly in honor of the martyred president, Lin coln, added to the interest in the exer- cises and undoubtedly increased the crowds, it being an idle day in many places. The factories, schools and business houses are closed, and alto- gether it is the gaeatest celebration Wa- terbury has ever witnessed. Despite the immense crowds on the street good order was maintained. Tele- grams were received by the local author ities from Boston, New York, Springfield and Hartford that many pickpockets and sneak thieves had left for Waterbury. It was also said that the city was over- run with lewd women, but up to 3 o'clock no complaints had been made to the police. The center of attraction was the visit ing Rebekas, 400 in number. The Meriden members paraded behind the band from the depot. They held a meeting in the Scovill house late this afternoon. The Meriden encampment acted as escort to the grand patriarch. The Decorations. The decorations were the most general (ItX. I vate residences vied with business houses ina an effort to outdo each other, with the result that almost every building in the center and many on the outskirts, too were resplendent with flags, bunting and bannerettesof every description. The visiting Oddfellows must have been led to believe, when looking at the different buildings, that their brethren in Water. bury owned the town. And they were right, for the place was theirs for to. day. Some of the decorations were 2 little amusing and caused the unitiateC to believe that those hanging them out meant to give ofiense to the order, bu this was not the case, as those convey sant with the mysteries of the order car attest. At the residence of J. B Wells on Livery street, within easy view of the visitors as they proceeded from the New England depot, a banner wa hung out with the picture of a jackas painted among reading matter so that i read, \"Nosahogan's Jackass Welcome You\" An unique emblem was set ou at the rooms of the Wheel club on Nortl Main street, consisting of three bicycl tires arranged so as to give an excellen representation of the triple links. A huge banner marked \"Welcome,\" gus pended across the street from the Well ton fountain to Irving block, met th eve of all who could crowd themselve into Exchange place, and one of the sam design was stretched from from abov the entrance to the City hall to one O the elms in the green. The latte was handsomely decorated with th triple links with the letters AsF. L. T.' neatly arranged in ihe links. When al are in the superlative degree it is no necessary to particularize; but no on could help admiring the great effort which were made to add to the majesty splendor of the Apothecaries hall build ing and the Bohl block. The new Od Fellows hall, Irving block, Lilley block , G. A. R. hall, and in fact every busines block in the center was in holiday at tire and the owners and occupants seeme to take a pride in the great artisti triumphs. A noticeable feature of th , decorations was a fair sprinkling o green flags, which seemed to lend ad dition alarm to the other colors. The I were the object of much attention Th rooms of the Catholic Literary associa tion and St Joseph's T. A. society in th . Lilley block add the Elks room b were also splendidly decorate , and a reference to this fact brought thi i remark from Alderman Cross, chairma of the committee Of arrangements While l am much pleased with the e1 forts of all classes of citizens to assist u in extending a warm welcome to ou - visiting friends, still I am not much suI : prsed at it.

If Mr. Corbett and Mr. Fitzsim- mons cannot come to this city and give such an exhibition as is provided for in pur article of agreement as they now stand-a limited number of rounds with soft gloves, the authorized officers being empowered to stop the exhibition if it be- comes brutal-then the exhibition will surely not take place in Hot Springs.

The matter will be brought into the courts as soon as we can get it there. If we cannot have the fight here, we have an absolute guarantee of protection from three different places in Mexico-one of them just across the Rio Grande from El Paso. Until we know just where we stand legally in this matter here we shall do nothing\" The ministers called a meeting at the Central Methodist church, and quite a crowd gathered. William A.

There were few subdued expressions of dissent, but calls to \"Speakl Speak\" began to ill the room, and Mr. Brady was permit ted to talk.

LITTLE RoCK, Oct. 15.-Governor Clark furnished fresh evidence of his determine tion to prevent the Corbett- Fitzsimmons fight at Hot Springs or in Arkansas. telegram was sent by the governor to Brigadier General John A. Taylor of For rest City of the Arkansas state guard summoning him to a conference at once. The meaning of the conference is that the governor desires to acquaint himself with the available strength of the state militia, so that he may act knowingly if the situa- tion at Hot Springs reaches a crisis where the services of the militia may be re- quired. General Taylor is expected to arrive to- day and consult with the governor. According to the offers contained in telegrams and letters received at the ex- ecutive office, Governor Clark estimates that the services of 10, 000 men are at his nisposal for the purpose of putting down the fight if needed. These offers come from all parts of the state. Clark Deternincd to Prevent the Fight. A vigorous determination to prevent the ight is plainly discernable in the sig nifcant proceedings at the executive office.  ic than ever in saying that the fight would not be allowed to come off in Arkansas. He goes so far as to say that if the affair bcours as advertised at Hot Springs he would resign and try to find an oIiice that he could run. The governor says Corbet5 and Fitzsimmons have been warned, and tf they now arrive at Hot Springs bent on the mission of fighting their presence in the city or county will be considered an overt act and will be treated accordingly. The governor says he will do everything within the scope of his power to prevent the big mill. He says that he realizes that Hot Springs is anxious to retrieve its past misfortunes, and he would like to help the city, but in this instance his duty is blain, and he will use his utmost dili- pence and power to do what it is his duty Eo do. He would not like to put the state to the expense of sending several comps nies of the state militia to Hot Springs, and he hopes the principals and their backers in the proposed fghts together with all parties concerned or interested. will not impose the necessity of ordering the militia to tho scene inn order to stop the fight Concluding his interview, Gov ernor Clark said he did not want to see nny blood shed as a result of the pugilists refusal to refrain from making prepara- tions to fight He sincerely hoped that 1t would be avoided \"I ann neither seeking nor slighting any besponsibility in this matter,\" he contin- hed, \"and will do my duty.\" When questioned in reference to the proposition to change the affair into a glove context, Governor Clark said that he could make no distinction between a glove contest and a prize fght.

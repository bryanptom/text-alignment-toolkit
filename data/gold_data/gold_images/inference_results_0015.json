Fortunately for hiln tho east wind held on, and the tempcrature was 18 above zero during the night. During the next few days tbe weather was thick and disagreeable, and the wind off shore. The people thought the current would carry him north of tho Dlomedes Islands At hls home he was mourned for, as one dead. Five weeks later, when he put in his appearance at tho mission. it seem- ed as though one had returned from the dead. But seeing that a Diomedes Eskimo accompanied hlm, tho manner of his rescue was evident.

After they had cllmb:d up the steep hill-sides, the people got between them and the sea and began battle which lasted two days, and resulted in the slaughter of almost the entire herd. Fearing the report of guns.would stampede them, only lances were used. As tlte herd was composed principally of l\"rge bull walrus, many of the struggles were very exciting, but resulted in no cas. ualties to the natives. A few walrus which escaped to the sea were pursued in skin boats, and killed. No attempt will bc nade to dry the skins at this scason of the year. They will be used for food along with the meat.

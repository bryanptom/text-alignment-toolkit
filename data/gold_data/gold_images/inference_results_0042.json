      "raw_text": "If the lumber company is to be permitted to collect toll from the settlers of Long valley, why should they not pay a just proportion of the taxes of the county? Two years ago they bought between 33,000 and 34,000 acres of timber from the state, paying 81 cents per thousand feet. This timber was sold at public sale and for cash. This time it has been assessed at 43 cents per thousand feet; why should it not be assessed at 81 cents per thousand feet? Mrs. Wm. Doering met with a painful accident a few days ago. In decending a steep hill she slip ped and fell, fracturing the knee cap. Mr. Doering, who is working near Ola, was immediately tele- phoned for. When seen yesterday he said the injured limb was doing as well as could be expected. John Connyers started for Sal mon river with his stock last Fri day.

      "raw_text": "mHuCSPOaXIH8 9OH0voUS. We wish to agree with the AD- vocATE in regard to irrigation. We have in our part of the valley three canals under construction. One is out of Boulder creek, owned by William Bothwell and Mart Nelson, covers several hundred acres, and will be ready for use next year. The settlers southwest of Roseberry have another ditch building which when completed will cover about two thousand acres of land. And there is also a settlers ditch on the south side of Gold Fork which is taken out of that stream about three-fourths of a mile above Sult's sawmilf. They expect to have this canal completed next year; the dam across Gold Fork is almost done, and this is the hardest part of the work. This canal will cover all the land for miles down the valley, which means a great deal. The speaking contests held at the Roseberry school house the evenings of Nov. 24th and 25th were a grand success, and were largely attended. A number oj people from Vanwyck, Center and Lardo were present. In the ad- vanced contest the prizes were awarded as follows: First prize $500, Nelly Parks; second, $1.00 Mervin Looms; third, 75c., Roy Blankinship. The prizes in tho primary contests were awarded a2 follows: First, $3.00, Russel Loo mig; second, $1.00, Clark Hamil ton; third, 50c., Charlie Stredder These contests closed the school. 0. W.

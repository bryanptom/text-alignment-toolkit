Mr Clapp started off by asking: \"Where are we?\" and saying that some mighty strange doctrines had been propounded said he was a protectionist, but favored the promised revision downward. It would be impossible in his opinion for the democrats and \"progressiVe\" repub- licans to join forces all along the line, owing to the difference in their principles. He appealed to the high-protection ad- vocates to do the trick. \"Howling Farce,\" Says He. He ridiculed the idea that the platform declare for revision downward in spirit and was not so understood. \"If it meant that we were to stand by iaW, w are confronted by the ridiculous spectacle of the chief executive calling us in special session to reaffirm for all time something that doesn't need reaffirming. If it did not mean revision downward the whole thing is a farce. \"If l thought we were here to reafirm the Dingley law, I would pack my grip and go home at once for I am not re- .quired by my oath as a senator to par- ticipate in such a farce\" He Labels \"the Enemy.\" It was rumored, continued the Minne- sotan, that those who promised revision downward would not be able to carry out their promise. He didn't believe that, but thought when the bill was complete it would be a fair reduction. \"The enemy of protection today,\" he declared, ..is the man who, having the power abuses it. You may not heed the clamor today, but in two years you will be driven to it and will learn that the people are determined to have it. Look Two Years Ahead! \"If you don't do it now you will find that in two years the enemies of pro- tection will revise the tariff. You will either redeem that promise now or the people will arise in their wrath and strike down the whole principle for which we re- publcans contend.\"",

A. w. Mohtfort. is a photographer who does a large amount of commercial work, and whenever a firm wished a baby boys picture to advertise its goods Mr. Montfort used his little son as a model. Some of the firms using the boys picture are national advertisers. and thus the face of the lad has looked from street cars, newspapers. magazines and bilboards upon residences of hundreds of towns and cities. In one of his most widely known poses the boy is smiling as a brand of talcum powder is being shaken over him. In an- other noted pose he is playing with a safety razor and laughing.

The latter and Mr. Wood were near the doors and escaped in extreme neglige as the train came to a stop. Exit Blocked by Flames. Meanwhile Mr. Turner, occupying compartment near the center of the car, aroused by the heat and the shouts of his companions, opened the corridor door only to find his exit blocked by the flames, which had been famed to fury by the rapid rate at which the train was moving. He promptly turned to the window and smashed the glass with his I1SU, no OUner 1nStrufnenU De1nS dU nand, the sash refusing to budge. The train, however. was obeying Mr. Woods signal with prodigious jerks, which alarmed the entire passenger list, and presently came to a standstill at tower S. Here the train crew from the outside succeeded in raising the sash, and Mr. Turner was assisted to safety with no injury more serious than a slightly cut hand. Salvaged Their Clothes. The crew likewise made salvage of the raiment in the burning car. The car was then shunted onto a siding and left to burn. The train pulled into Chicago minus one car, but otherwise none the worse for the experience. The officials came wsst from Pittsburg on routine trip and -stopped only a short time in this city-just long enough, in fact, to catch the first train back to Pittsburg. The fire is believed to have been due to crossed electric wires, although there ts a possibility that it started from a spark from the locomotive.",

      "raw_text": "PARIS, May 7.-Both public sympathy and the law seem today to be clearly against the Posts, Telegraphs and Tele- phones Employers Association, which yes- terday threw down the gage of battle to the government by transforming itself into a syndicate, or union, under the laws of 1S84. This would place the association on the same footing as the workmen's unions. The action was calculated to give it the right to strike against its employer, the state. Strike Proposition Referred. The congress of railroad men, at a secret session held today. decided to sub- mit the question of a general strike to a referendum and appointed permanent strike committee. Dispatches received here from Havre Lyons and other cities say that the Posts. Telegraphs and Telephones Em- ployes' Association has voted in principle for a general strike. The newspapers this morning, with the exception of the extreme socialist or- sans, are unsparing in their denunciation of the step taken by the association as an act of rebellion. They urge the gov- ernment to proceed with energy and crush the insurrection before the movement in- gulfs the other categories of state em- poyes. Federation Directs Plan. Evidence accumulates today that the formation of this union yesterday was only the first step in a far-reaching plan of the General Federation of Labor to place the entire machinery of the gov- ernment at its mercy. The law of 1854 limits unions to pro- fessions and trades engaged in \"com- petitive industry\" The attorney general of the republic is to decide summarily that the \"syndicate\" is illegal and order its dissolution. As soon as this is done the organizers of the movement will be subject to heavy fines and imprisonment if they persist in meeting. The issue between the \"syndicaliets\" drawn by yesterdays events A general strike is considered probable in the im- meulate future. Government Will Fight. The government. which is preparing 4or the threatened conflict. has caused the word to go out that it intends to gov- ern. When the delegates of the various cat egories of employees in the bureau of posts and telegraphs visited the ministry of the interior. where they expected to find Pre- mier Clemenceau, yesterday morning. they were told that he was not in. They bore a letter granting their request for an audience. It is true M. Clemen- ceau has been ill for several weeks, but no explanation was made. What steps the disaffected employees will taKe is not yet known. The day has been spent in perfecting their organization. The government further defied its emi- ployes yesterday by suspending M. Pau- ron leader of the recent strike. Under the personal direction of the premier and Minister of Labor Barthou energetic measures have been taken against a walkout Ten thousand candidates for postal work have been enrolled. Guards have been placed over the telegraph and tele- phone switchboards. Automobils have been reserved. Sol- diers have been trained for postal work.",

Mrs. Willard and the child wife were on hand at the morgue long before the hour appointed for the hearing to be- gin. A crowd of the curious was already on hand. \"We only want to see the little wife.\" several female spectators admitted. and disappeared after their curiosity had been satisfied. The child wife. dressed fn white and wearing a hat trimmed with white lace and green vines. occupied . seat beside her mother, while her father sat at the table with his counsel. T. c. Taylor. As- sistant United States Attorney Charles H. Turner was present with Detective McNamee to look after the interests of the prosecution, and when the hearing had been concluded they took the state ments of several witnesses. On her way from the morgue Dorothy Beck stopped long enough to recognize her father. but showed no emotion. Beck Funeral Nest Monday. Undertaker Thomas R.

Beck was in a dying condi- tion. the result of three bullet wounds, two in the chest and one in tho left side.

It was found that one bullet had penetrated the liver of the wounded man. and that his life could not be saved. Sergt. Ryan of the fifth precinct testi- ied that he went to the scene of the shooting yesterday afternoon and found a crowd on the sidewalk. Some of the men in the crowd were holding Willard down and witness told them to release him. About that time he saw . man slip a white-handled pistol to Capt. Williams. \"Have you the pistol?\" asked the coro- ner. \"Yes. sir.\" responded the witness, turn- ing over the weapon. \"Is it loaded?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Who unloaded it?\" \"Capt. Williams\" The coroner questioned Capt. Williams, who said three chambers were empty when Adolph Arneson gave him the weapon. Arneson, fireman at the Penn- sylvania station, who testified that he was acquainted with Beck, was on his way home yesterday when he saw Wil- lard come out of Lorenzo Simis' saloon at New Jersey avenue and street. He had heard of the trouble in the morning, and when he saw Willard go in the di- rection of the Beck store he followed.

But it soon pulled its head in and inquiries began to fly, and now both head and tall are out of sight. There's something curious about it all. as would be natural with any frst-class mystery. For two days members of the Senate committee on judiciary have been drop- ping in upon the President, by invitation from the chief executive They have been dropping out as noiselessly as they knew how. They have been turning down all questions at the rate of 9o8 a minutes, at the same time giving the tip that the President had put them under a special inhibition of confluence This morning he talked with Senators Culberson, Rayner, Bacon and Paynter, democratic members of the committee He saw Senator Overt man, another democrat, yesterday, and likewise talked with Senators Clark. Dil- lingham, Piles, Warner and Borah, re- publicans. They all wore the solemn look the democrats carried with them today. The democrats asserted that the confer- ence in no way related to political ques- tions, but further than that they stopped short. The best information is that the matter relates to a judgeship nominee | whose history is pretty well known to members of the committee and that the President does not desire to have any one done an injustice by the talk that would follow any publication of the matter. Various Suggestions Offered. Various suggestions were made during the day as to possible legislative problems | the President wished to settle or have taken up now. One was as to the commod- ities clause provision of the Hepburn railway rate law and the understood wish of the President that this be amended so as to prevent stock ownership by rail- roads in companies handling commodities really belonging to the railroads. The inn probability, however, to taking this up in advance of the next session of Congress and the still greater improbability that the committee could be brought together upon any problem of that kind at this time dispels that theory. Invitations for the President. Senator Paynter of Kentucky asked the President today to attend the meeting of the Kentucky Retail Grocery Association at Frankfort the 10th of this month. The President said he was sorry he could not go. Alvin Martin of Norfolk republican na- tional committeeman of Virginia, asked | ii\"t b0 able to visit Norfolk in June, according to the invitation extended him by the board of trade of that city. The President said he thought he would be able to run down to Norfolk next month. No Quarrel in the Cabinet. The cabinet meeting today was com- paratively short one. Secretaries Wilson and Ballinger were both asked about the alleged row between themselves and their of withdrawn of sites for forest ranges. \"It is made out of the whole cloth,' declared Secretary Wilson. \"There is ab- solutely no truth in the story\" Secretary Ballinger said practically the same thing, deciaring that the basis of the whole story had been a mere matter of administrative detail and interpreta- tion of law, which at no time threatened any unpleasant relations between himself and the head of the Department of Agri- culture. Wants to Name Judge Willard. President Taft desires to name Charles A. Willard, a Minnesota man. as judge of the district court at Minneapolis, in place of Judge Milton D. Purdy, resign ed. Mr. Willard was a judge in the Philippines for a numbef or years, and is a personal friend of the President, who knows him to be well qualified for a place on the bench Senator Nelson who is a member of the judiciary com- mittee. is evidently opposed to Mr. Wil- lard, as he was to Mr. Purdy, or the members of the judiciary committee about | the matfer.",

The great bronze figure representing the poet. seated, ant with a book in his hand, is placed upon a block of Bonacord granite brought from Sweden and carved in Scotland. The fg- ure of the poet is the work of an Amer ican sculptor. William Couper of New York city. The statue is on the little tri- angle of grass at Connecticut avenue, 18th street and M street. The exercises began at 2:30 o'clock grandchild of the poet pulled the silken cord which broke loose the enfold ing flags. revealing the monument As the flags floated upward and remained suspended in the air and the wonderful face of Longfellow, carved in bronze, was revealed, the great throng was silent fo1 a moment and then broke into a soon taneous cheer. It was the climax of a great labor. occupying twelve years for its completion, and represented the con fributions of thousands upon thousands of persons, from cities and hamlet< khroughout the whole broad land. The nation did honor to the poet whose works. transplanted into neariy every modern iangunget have sung the beau- ties of American life. have told in most beautiful word pictures of the distinctly American features of the birth and up- bringing of the states of America And as the nation has contributed its mites as well as its greater sums toward the completion of the statue. so were there present men who represent the national government and men and women who as private citizens stand for the highest ideals in the communities of which they are part The list of those who faced the statue at its unveiling contains the names of ambassadors of great foreign nations lawmakers and judges, and chief among these was Melville Weston Fuller. chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He pre- sided over the ceremonies. President Unable to Attend. President Taft was compelled toda, to abandon the idea of attending the unveiling. owing to a badly infiamed eye over which he is wearing a light ban dage. A gnat or some other small in. sect flew into Mr. Taft's eye while he was horseback riding Wednesday after noon. The President gave little atten iion to the matter at the time, but yes- terday his eye was much irritated His physician thought that the glare of the bright sunlight today would be bad fol the eye, and advised him not to venture put.

Others present were representatives from the courts of Europe and the gov- ernments of American republics, citizens Dr Washington whose names are con nected with every great event of the capital, and visitors whom any city would be proud to entertain. Descendants of the Poet Present. Not the least interesting feature of the hnveiling was the presence of many of the descendants of the poet. Not every living descendant was present today, but more than enough to fully represent the Iamily of the man whose memory was honored. They were: Mrs. R. H. Dana, daughter; Mrs. H. c leRham. second, granddaughter; R. H Dana, jr., grandson; H. E. L. Dana grandson; Miss Delta F. Dana, grand iaughter; the Misses Thorp. granddaugh. ters; Miss M. K.

Buford of Kansas City appeared before the council with a proposition to erect a gas plant here. He will at the next meeting ask for a a franchise to lay pipes in the streets. Mr. Buford agrees that the prlce of gas shall not be more than $1.10 per thousand feet with of rebate of 10 cents if paid promptly each month. This is considered a very low rate in the cities and will enable Abilene peo- ple to cook on gas ranges at a less ex- pense than coal or gasoline, besides being remarkably convenient. Light will also be furnished of an ex. cellent quality and the city will be offered street lamps at $12 per lamp year. This is very cheap and would supplement the arc lamps in parts of the city where the larger lamps are not needed. Mr. Buford comes with high recommendations and ample backing. If he locates a plant here it will make another indus- try for the town and make Abilene more metropolitan.",

Stanley had tendered the New York School of Art and Design scholorship to Miss Lillie Dyer of this place. Several months ago this scholarship was presented to the State, which, in turn, through the governor, was to be presented to the one whom he thought most worthy of it. A dozen or more applications were made to the governor for the scholarship, and is much to Miss Dyer's credit that she was selected. Miss Dyer graduated from the Abilene high school several years ago and for more than a year has been con. ducting her millinery store in Con- cordia. She has always displayed considerable artistic ability in her drawings, sketches, etc., and it was with much pleasure that her many friends learned that she had received the scholarship.",

      "raw_text": "The Huntington Herald announces lhat tue Mable has made a \"success- 'ul\" trip to Ballard's s Landing and .eturn and has fully demonstrated lhe easy navigahility of the Snake by going down empty, coming back empty, bending an eccentric, break ing down feed pump (which gener- ally is caused by failure of engine to furnish sufficient steam), displaying an insufiieient coaling capacity, the need of a new wheel and steam capslan, not to speak of hanging up on rocks, aud placid condition of river. But the Herald's account way as well be given: \\ The Steamer Mable returned to Gray's Landing on Monday, the l+th inst, af 3 o'clock. from her trial trip down to Bal- lards Landing. On this trip she demon- strated beyond question her abilitv to navigate the Snake between these points The trip down was made ii five hours and twentv minutes. The return trip occupied abouL thirtysix hours. delay be- ing caused by the bending of an ecccn- trc rod, the breaking down of the feed pump. and shortage of coal which necessitated the making of steam by the gathering of drift-wood wherever it could be found along the shore. She had but three tons of coal aboard in the bunkers when she started down the river. It was demonstrated that tbe s:eainei had plenty of power in her to come ovei most of the rapids. There are tnree rap ids which will always probably, have t( be \"llned\" over, that is, a rope takel ashore and the boat assisted over the rap | lds by her steam capslan. It is beieveo she will make the round trip iu two days Leaving Gray's Landng carly in tht morning she will make lhe run down t' Ballard's Lundiug in four hours. Takin- on her load she will start on her returt trip tying up when night overtakes her She will thus make Grays Landing. he starting point. easily un the foiowing day The wheel had but twelve-incn blade or buckets on this trip, which was rouno to be a defect The blades will bc in creased to eighteen inches and the stean capslan placed in position before makinl another trip The first trip was mad with a hand capstan because of the fac that a portion of !he steam capstan ha been lost cnroutc to Huntington. It certainly doesn't take much to constitute success if the above is ev idcnce of it. The boat was \"buil bv the best experts\" but some change are necessary, and the continued ai tempt at solution of the puzzle wi he watched with interest The llel old llas one typographical error, how ever, in stating the boat went dow to Ballards Landing Our inform: tion (pretty good) is to the effect thi the Mable only went as fur as Oxbov 15 miles this side of Builarti A There is some bad water there tli: it did not attempt to pass. It woul be a good idea to incorporate a rai way company to build a I5 mile cpl nection between Ballard's Landir and Oxbow. In reading the Hera account, remember it was hut a fe weeks ago that it stated the river fro Bay Horse down to bc as \"placid the Willamette. |\" The final sul ming up of the enterprise must b that if the pitiful methods of tran portatiun indicated hy the above e tract from the Herald are sufiicie to handle the Seven Devils Copt camp-theu the Seven Devils Copy camp is a pitiful humhug, is n what it has been proclaimed to | does not justify large investments capital and lias no magnitude wh ever as resource. The camp ii fzzle if such abortionate facilit are competent to operate it.",

In fact, it looks very nearly unanimous. Columbus known the value of inter-urban roads, and is after all of them she can get. When the electric road was built from Pittsburg to Columbus the town took on new life, and drew hun- dreds of people from the coal mining districts to the north to live in Columbus. People from the country traversed by the road send their children to Columbus to school. All these things made Columbus a good town, and that is one of the reasons she wants this road. And all of these reasons are mighty good ones why Baxter Springs must also have the road. If it is a rood thing for Colum- bus it will be a good thing for Baxter Springs. If the road should be built to Columbus and not to Baxter Springs, . lot of the trade from the west of Bax- ter would be diverted to Colum- bus. We can not allow any such thing as that to happen. And we are glad to know that the opposition to the road in Baxter Springs is growing less every day. Let every good citizen get up into the collar and boost for the road. Friday, Nov. 12, is the day for us to say by our votes whether or not we want it. The answer will be \"yes.\" Of course it will.",

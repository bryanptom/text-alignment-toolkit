      "raw_text": "The mail order houses have new advertising trick. They are sending agents from town to town With quantities. oft goods to be dis- posed of at ridiculously low prices or even in some cases to be given away without money and without price. These agents are usually skilled performers and begin their operations with a free open. air concert to attract the people. Once the crowd has gathered, the trunks are opened and the goods begin to move out. And one of these fakirs will handle five times as many goods as all the stores of the town will handle in the same time. What nex*, we wonder. Is not the situa- tion rather anomalous? On the one hand we have the huge cata- logue houses scattering money with lavish hand for advertising purposes and demanding and making new opportunities for sending more. As against these, we find the hone merchants, whom we all wish to protect, looking on half indifferently. even sleepily, looking to their friends to be their sf ield and their defense. And be- tween the two, the local press, the advertiser's spokesman, courted by the alien with his gold, yet re- pelling him and making the fight almost single-handed for home in- stitutions. And the editor, mark you, is wondering in his inmost soul whether patriotism ia these days is a paying proposition.",

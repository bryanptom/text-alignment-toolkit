When trees stand stiff in gloom Beneath the sunless morn, Old Farmer John salutes his sheaves 0f ripened corn. Bright jewels 'mong the stubble glenn, And sparkle from his careless tread, And gossamer, outspread, Enrobes the naked thorn But Farmer John, to all a dream, Moves through his corn. The startled hare before him springs, And down the furrow speeds like wind, While crisp leaves spirt behind The yellow mists, upl orne, Skim er the vale on noiseless wings Above the corn. But Farmer John with anxious eyes The struggling streaks of dawn surveys, And through the spreading haze That veils the face of morn A blood-red rim he sees arise To greet his corn. And fear creeps through his trembling veins As the rising sun dilates in red: And as each mountain's head His crimson hues adorn, John quakes to think the coming rains May swamp his corn. Still high o'erhead the waning moon Reveals a patch of clearing blue, And hope comes peering tbrough With Luna's welcome horn That yet a favoring sky at noon Will bless the corn. The changeful sun, erst steeped in fire, Behold. pours fourth rich amber streams That quench with bright joy-gleams The frowns his face had worn, For Heaven and he may now conspire To save the corn. See, o'er the east a golden mantle's fungl Fast move the mists from out the north, And as the winds come forth, To little shreds arc torn The great cloud masses that o'erhung The golden corn. And lo! the wakened crows soar high How arrow-straight they upward fly Der bits of dappled sky, And leave the earth forlorn While clouds of lazy rooks float by The tempting corn.l What smiles sleep in the farmers eyes To-day hell \"in' that precious grain, For he knows the dreaded rain Such bodngs dare not scorn. So, whistling thanks to sun and skies. He leaves the corn.",

      "raw_text": "As New York attracts visitors from all parts of the world, says a city letter, the hotels are well patronized. Some new features, however, are now intro duced which show how wealth and lux- ury can increase the cost of support. Here is a Fifth avenue establishment, not intended for transient guests, but for boarders of the highest rank. It contains no single rooms, being laid out in suites of three or more. The rent is $40 to $160 per week, to which is added the price of board, which is not less than $20 per week. There are families at the Sherwood whose bill is S1,000 per month, and if the reader is desirous of getting rid of his money in an elegant as well as rapid man, ner, he will know where to take rooms. The Broadway hotels charge from $3 50 to S5 per day. Other houses rent rooms by the night or week, and the guests take their meals at the restaurant in the basement. Lovejoy, the originator of this system, became famous in his day and made a fortune. He charged 50 cents nightly for rooms, but at present the price is $1. In addition to this there are cheap hotels near Washington market, which are always full and ace making money at a very handsome rate. They charge from 35 cents to 75 cents for rooms, and the guests eat in the restaurant. These houses attract solid class which only seeks comfort and econ- omy, and hence is willing to put up in the plebian precincts of Washington market",

      "raw_text": "Mr. Fitzwalter was the pastor of an impoverished but genteel colored con- gregation in Port Royal, and for Mr. Fitzwalter I had a rooted if an ungodly aversion, founded upon the two trifiing facts that he grinned at the beginning and the close of every remark he ut- tered, and that in conversing he always picked out the showiest words in the dic- tionary, with more regard to sound than sense. However, he had a poor sick wife, and in consequence I frequently visited the Fitzwalter's apartment, and always found the family poor indeed. \"You have no relations here,\" said to Mrs Fitzwalter one day. \"It must be lonely for you.\" \"I ann alone in the world, as far as I know. was an orphan when I went to Hampton. I was born in Texas, and I lived there with my mother till she died. My mother was bought by a Louisiana gentleman, somewhere in Virginia, out of the Smith family. I've heard her say she nursed her master through a dan- gerous illness, and he set her free out of gratitude. That was how she happened to move up into Texas when she mar- ried. My father was free too\" Mrs. Fitzwalter spoke of the Smith family as though the fact of her mother having once been owned by them con- ferred a special distinction upon herself. It was undeniably a widely known fam- ily. \"Smith ?\" I repeated, penslvely. \"Yes,\" Mrs. Fitzwalter rejoined ; \"I've often heard my mother say they were one of the very first families.\" Here Mr. Fitzwalter entered, grin- ning, aronsing the worst feelings of my nature. \"You have very pleasant rooms,\" I re- marked, with forced politeness. \"Yes. I ann anxious to procure an instrument for my wife as soon as posi- sible. That imparts an air of refinement to the individual-I should say to the apartment.

I did not discuss the point, how ever. The next day I had occasion to visit my favorite pensioner, very old colored woman-so old that her age had be- come mere matter of speculation. She herself assured me, every time I saw | her, that she was nigh a hundred. She lived with a married daughter and this woman's husband, whose prominent characteristic, as far as I had discov- eyed, was that of being chronically out of work. He was sitting on the porch, smoking a reeking pipe when I arrived. \"Nothing to do, Uncle Ben ?\" queried. To which he grunted an inarticulate as- sent. \"De wages my ole man receive depen upon de estimation ob de stone,\" ex- plained his wife, coming to the rescue and to the doorway. was at A loss only for a moment, until I recollected that Uncle Bcn had been breaking stones of late. \"How is Mammy Nelly ?\" inquired, making my way into the house. \"She's lively,\" grunted her son-in-lau W again.

      "raw_text": "at Morrison's Hotel, in Dublin, early Thursday morning on two warrants signed by Mr. Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland. One warrant charges him with inciting the intimidation of tenants from paying rent justly due, and the other with intimidating tenants from taking the benefit of the Land act, by applying to the Land Commission to fis fair rent. Mr. Parnell was taken to Kilmainham jail. His arrest has created great excitement. His arrest was determined on at pro longed session of the Cabinet Council at which all the members of the Council except Lord Selborne were present. Since Mr. Gladstone's speeches at Leeds some of the Ministerial journals in Lon. don have been saying vaguely that inn mediate executive interference was nec, essary to make the Land act anything but dead letter. The arrest or Par. nell, however, was entirely unexpected. Immediately after the close of the Cabi- net Council Secretary Forster left Lon don for Dublin, and upon his arrival there by the morning mail at o'clock Thursday, issued forthwith his warrants to the Dublin Detective Oflice. Mr. Par nell was stopping at Morrison's, and was to take a morning train from the Kingsbridge station to attend the con- vention of the Kildare Land and Labor League. One squad of detectives, fol- lowed by considerabie military force, went into the railway station, where, a crowd had gathered to see Mr. Parnell off. It was thought likely that he had already boarded his train. The detect tives went over the train without at- tracting attention, and the crowd sup- posed that the soldiers had been called out merely to preserve order. Meanwhile, under command of Detect tive Superintendent Mallins, six detect tives went to Morrisons hotel, which had been carefully watched from the time Mr. Parnel entered it last evening\" All were in citizen's clothes. Superin- tendent Mallins found that Parnell was still in bed, and sent up word that he would like to see him. Mr. Parnell re- turned a message that he would see the as soon as he was dressed, and presently word came down that he was ready. Mallins took Detect tive Sheridan up stairs with him. Mr. Parnell received them pleasantly, and asked if he was to be arrested. Mallins handed him one of the warrants. The ink of Chief Secretary Forster's signa- ture was not yet dry. Mallins suggested that Mr. Parnell go with him quietly and immedlately, so that there should be no chance of disturbance. \"All right\" said Parnell, and put on his hat. The two policemen escorted him to the door, where a cab was wait ing for him. It was then half past nine. The cab was driven directly to Kilmain- ham prison, the other detectives follow ing in another carriage. Mr. Parnell was warmly welcomed by the suspects in the prison Nobody at the hotel and none of the bystanders on the street knew that Mr. Parnell was under arrest, and there was no demonstration of any kind. There was a good deal of excite ment, however, over the news when it became known, and the newspaper offices were besieged. On the chance of a disturbance, the entire garrison of the city is in barracks, held ready to march at any moment. It was reported that the arrest of Parnell was only a prelimi- nary to still more vigorous action against the Land League. The Secre- tary of the League was interviewed shortly after the arrest. He expressed much astonishment at it, and exclaimed, \"Let them come on; we are ready for them!\" Father Sheehy, Patrick Egan and V. B. Dillon went to Paris to-day. It is believed that ParnelTs speech at Wexford Sunday furnished the Govern- ment's technical justification for his ar- rest, which the Moderate Liberals and the Conservatives approve. The Land League Executive held long session Thursday at Morrison's. Messrs. John Dillon, Arthur O'Connor and A. M. Sullivan, members of Parlia- ment, were present. Mr. Dillon made a fiery speech, and lt was proposed that the League should issue an address. It s said that Mr. Dillon, who is M. P. for Tipperary, will assume the Presidency of the League. Mr. Dillon said at the meeting that it was the most trying and critical moment in Ireland's hlstory for century. The statement that Mr. Parnell had intimi- iated the people was false. He defied anybody to point to single speech of Mr. Parnell in favor of intimidation. His arrest was due to private malice. It was the duty of the nation to deal with the matter coolly and with judgment, md to maintain the struggle within the law. An additional guard and two nine- pounders have been stationed in the upper Castle yard. The guard at Kil- mainham jail has been doubled. At meeting of the North Dublin Board of Guardians, Mr. Kenny, the medical officer and medical attendant upon the suspects in Kilmainham jail, stated that he feared Mr. Kettle, the suspect, was threatened with spinal disease, and that there could not be the slightest doubt that Mr. Kettles symptoms were due to his confinement. Mr. Kenny added that he had reported to the Government on the subject. The inhabitants of Lismore closed their shops on the reception of the news of Mr. Parnell's arrest.

      "raw_text": "to see her to-morrow morning.. Re. member me to her,\" \"I will certainly do my best to exer. cise your commission, miss,\" Mr. Fits. walter replied, elaborately, passing on. My marketing had up to this point been done in front of the shop, where most of the wares were displayed. now retired within, and made the resl of my purchases in seclusion. The next day I looked up Mrs. Fitzwalter, who was too ailing to come to my house, but who wished to consult me as to the alternative of doing plain wing or ol giving music lessons, both of which pre seated themselves to her mind as means | of adding to her income. She showed me some of her work, and she played fol me a little on the \"pyano.\" I decided directly in favor of the sewing, although with reluctance, because could see she had a preference for the other method of earning a living. Moreover, I had some work I wanted to have done imme. diately, and which promised to send her. On my way out picked up an old-fashioned ambrotype displayed in a shows silt frame on the table, on which also reposed Milton's Paradise Lost ' and Longfellow's poems. The picture represented a staid, sad-eyed colored woman (the typical Southern mammy), a turban about her head, gold ear-rings, a gold ring on one of her hands, clasped together in the composed fashion of her race. \"How much your little boy looks like this picture !\" I cried. \"Is it your mother?\" \"Yes, miss,\" wiping it with her apron of any chance dust-\" my mother. She was a good woman if ever there was one.\" Another resemblance flashed through my mind. I felt myself on the brink of a discovery. \"What was your mothers name ?\" I inquired. \"Matilda Smith. She always kept the name of the Virginia family she came out of. She belonged to the Louisiana Leveres afterward, but she never took their name. Yes, Smith was her maiden name. My father's name was Willis; so she died Matilda Willis. She has been dead a good ten yoars now. She followed my father within  I sat down again. \"I think-I ann not quite sure-but I have an idea that l know some of your mothers relations, Mrs. Fitzwalter. How would you feel about claiming kin |? They are very poor, plain people,\" \"I should be very glad to have rele tions near me- I often feel lonely Mother was sold away when she was only five or six years old, so that she had no distinct recollection of her people but when she was near her end, she used to say she wished she had written to her mother, and tried to find out something about her; that is, had had a letter written. She never learned to write herself. suppose that hin- dered the letters getting off\" \"You lived in Texas ?\" \"Yes; near San Antonio. We lived there seventeen years-all my life up to that time ten years ago, as said. My mother was right young woman when she died, not more than thirtyfour. That was her age as near as she could calculate\" \"If I find out anything more about your family, I will let you know,\" I said, making another move. As went away, I thought to myself, \"I believe I hoUe found dear old Nelly's lost 'Tilda;\" and [ felt a throb of satisfaction, even if mother and daughter could never in this life meet face to face. I stated my errand gradually to Mam- my Nelly when went to see her the next day. I reminded her of our con- versation about her daughter. \"I think I have found out something about her,\" \"Are she a-libin' ?\" asked the old wo- man, eagerly. \"I think not, unless am all wrong,\" I answered, gently. \"I cud hardly hab expected it,\" she said, shaking her head, sadly. \"Forty years sence she war sol' away. Heaps ob changes comes in forty years. But you go on, honey. Tell me wat you hab heerd.\" \"I have seen the daughter of a wo- man whose name was Matilda Smith, and who was sold out of the Smith fam- ily in Virginia into the Levere family in Louisiana.\" \"Dat mug be my 'Tilda. Good Lori\" \"So it seems to me. This Matilda Smith was set free by her master, and afterward married a man who was also free, with whom she went to live in Texas, pear San Antonio\" \"It war near San Antonio dat I libed four year, off an' on.\" \"How strange that is! You were so near that you might almost have touched each other, and never knew it.\" I could have wept to think of it-the joy of meeting so close to them, and yet they had not met! Where had their guardian angels been all those months ? \"Afterward Matilda Smith died,\" I went on. \"She left one daughter, who is living with her husband and child in Port Royal now. She is Mrs. Fitzwal- ter her husband is a preacher. She has her mothers picture, which looks extremely like you, Mammy Nelly. Would you like to see it? ?\" \"Indeed I wud, chile,\" the old wo- man answered, with trembling eager- ness. I brought about an interview. The relationship between Mrs. Fitzwalter and Mammy Nelly was established be- yond any reasonable doubt, and the most cordial family relations were established. Mammy's whole heart went out to her little great-grandson. \"My 'Tilda war on'y a trife older when she went away\"",

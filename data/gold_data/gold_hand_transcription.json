      "text": "Mr. Fitzwalter was the pastor of an\nimpoverished but genteel colored con-\ngregation in Port Royal, and for Mr.\nFitzwalter I had a rooted if an ungodly\naversion, founded upon the two trifling\nfacts that he grinned at the beginning\nand the close of every remark he ut-\ntered, and that in conversing he always\npicked out the showiest words in the dic-\ntionary, with more regard to sound than\nsense. However, he had a poor sick\nwife, and in consequence I frequently\nvisited the Fitzwalter's apartment, and\nalways found the family poor indeed.\n\"You have no relations here,\" I said\nto Mrs. Fitzwalter one day. \"It must\nbe lonely for you.\"\n\"I am alone in the world, as far as I\nknow. I was an orphan when I went to\nHampton. I was born in Texas, and I\nlived there with my mother till she died.\nMy mother was bought by a Louisiana\ngentleman, somewhere in Virginia, out\nof the Smith family. I've heard her say\nshe nursed her master through a dan-\ngerous illness, and he set her free out of\ngratitude. That was how she happened\nto move up into Texas when she mar-\nried. My father was free too.\"\nMrs. Fitzwalter spoke of the Smith\nfamily as though the fact of her mother\nhaving once been owned by them con-\nferred a special distinction upon herself.\nIt was undeniably a widely known fam-\nily. \"Smith?\" I repeated, pensively.\n\"Yes,\" Mrs. Fitzwalter rejoined;\n\"I've often heard my mother say they\nwere one of the very first families.\"\nHere Mr. Fitzwalter entered, grin-\nning, arousing the worst feelings of my\nnature.\n\"You have very pleasant rooms,\" I re-\nmarked, with forced politeness.\n\"Yes. I am anxious to procure an\ninstrument for my wife as soon as pos-\nsible. That imparts an air of refinement\nto the individual\u2014I should say to the\napartment. I believe I mentioned to\none of you ladies\u2014I believe it was you-\nself\u2014that my wife could perform on the\npyano?\"\n\"I believe you did,\" with increasing\nintolerance. Then, in a lower voice, \"I\nwill try to send you the things on the\nlist you gave me, Mrs. Fitzwalter, which\nyou need most, at once.\"\nMrs. Fitzwalter smiled her wan smile;\nher lord followed me to the door and out\non the landing. \"In reference to your\nkindness, miss, I would say that a small\npiece of beef would be truly acceptable.\"\nMrs. Fitzwalter had already informed\nme that she had no fancy whatever for\nmeat. I did not discuss the point, how-\never.\nThe next day I had occasion to visit\nmy favorite pensioner, a very old colored\nwoman\u2014so old that her age had be-\ncome a mere matter of speculation. She\nherself assured me, every time I saw\nher, that she was nigh a hundred. She\nlived with a married daughter and this\nwoman's husband, whose prominent\ncharacteristic, as far as I had discov-\nered, was that of being chronically out\nof work. He was sitting on the porch,\nsmoking a reeking pipe when I arrived.\n\"Nothing to do, Uncle Ben?\" I queried.\nTo which he grunted an inarticulate as-\nsent.\n\"De wages my ole man receive depen'\nupon de estimation ob de stone,\" ex-\nplained his wife, coming to the rescue\nand to the doorway. I was at a loss\nonly for a moment, until I recollected\nthat Uncle Ben had been breaking \nstones of late.\n\"How is Mammy Nelly?\" I inquired,\nmaking my way into the house.\n\"She's lively,\" grunted her son-in-law\nagain. And so, in truth, I found her,\n",

Some\nnew features, however, are now intro-\nduced which show how wealth and lux-\nury can increase the cost of support.\nHere is a Fifth avenue establishment,\nnot intended for transient guests, but\nfor boarders of the highest rank. It\ncontains no single rooms, being laid\nout in suites of three or more. The\nrent is $40 to $160 per week, to which\nis added the price of board, which is\nnot less than $20 per week. There are\nfamilies at the Sherwood whose bill is\n$1,000 per month, and if the reader is\ndesirous of getting rid of his money\nin an elegant as well as rapid man-\nner, he will know where to take rooms.\nThe Broadway hotels charge from $3 50\nto $5 per day. Other houses rent rooms\nby the night or week, and the guests\ntake their meals at the restaurant in the\nbasement. Lovejoy, the originator of\nthis system, became famous in his day\nand made a fortune. He charged 50\ncents nightly for rooms, but at present\nthe price is $1. In addition to this\nthere are cheap hotels near Washington\nmarket, which are always full and are\nmaking money at a very handsome rate.\nThey charge from 35 cents to 75 cents\nfor rooms, and the guests eat in the\nrestaurant. These houses attract a solid\nclass which only seeks comfort and econ-\nomy, and hence is willing to put up in\nthe plebian precincts of Washington\nmarket.\n",

Evidently all social di-\ntinctions paled before the pretensions\nof the old woman's former owners.\nSmith? Smith? Who had been talk-\ning Smith to me only a short time be-\nfore? But my memory failed me. The\nname of Fitzwalter did not occur to me.\nPerhaps it was unreasonable in me to\nexpect to remember where last I had\nheard that not uncommon name.\n\"When my ole man die, I tell my two\nboys dey mus' look out for me in my ole\ndays, an' dey do try.

Re-\nmember me to her.\"\n\"I will certainly do my best to exer-\ncise your commission, miss,\" Mr. Fitz-\nwalter replied, elaborately, passing on.\nMy marketing had up to this point\nbeen done in front of the shop, where\nmost of the wares were displayed. I\nnow retired within, and made the rest\nof my purchases in seclusion. The next\nday I looked up Mrs. Fitzwalter, who\nwas too ailing to come to my house, but\nwho wished to consult me as to the\nalternative of doing plain sewing or of\ngiving music lessons, both of which pre-\nsented themselves to her mind as means\nof adding to her income. She showed\nme some of her work, and she played for\nme a little on the \"pyano.\" I decided\ndirectly in favor of the sewing, although\nwith reluctance, because I could see she\nhad a preference for the other method\nof earning a living. Moreover, I had\nsome work I wanted to have done imme-\ndiately, and which I promised to send\nher. On my way out I picked up an\nold-fashioned ambrotype displayed in a\nshowy gilt frame on the table, on which\nalso reposed Milton's \"Paradise Lost\"\nand Longfellow's poems. The picture\nrepresented a staid, sad-eyed colored\nwoman (the typical Southern mammy),\na turban about her head, gold ear-rings,\na gold ring on one of her hands, clasped\ntogether in the composed fashion of her\nrace.\n\"How much your little boy looks like\nthis picture !\" I cried. \"Is it your\nmother?\"\n\"Yes, miss,\" wiping it with her apron\nof any chance dust\u2014\"my mother. She\nwas a good woman if ever there was\none.\"\nAnother resemblance flashed through\nmy mind. I felt myself on the brink of\na discovery. \"What was your mother's\nname?\" I inquired.\n\"Matilda Smith. She always kept\nthe name of the Virginia family she\ncame out of. She belonged to the\nLouisiana Leveres afterward, but she\nnever took their name. Yes, Smith was\nher maiden name. My father's name\nwas Willis; so she died Matilda Willis.\nShe has been dead a good ten years\nnow. She followed my father within\nfour months of his death.\"\nI sat down again. \"I think\u2014I am\nnot quite sure\u2014but I have an idea that\nI know some of your mother's relations,\nMrs. Fitzwalter. How would you feel\nabout 'claiming kin?' They are very\npoor, plain people.\"\n\"I should be very glad to have rela-\ntions near me. I often feel lonely.\nMother was sold away when she was\nonly five or six years old, so that she\nhad no distinct recollection of her\npeople; but when she was near her end,\nshe used to say she wished she had\nwritten to her mother, and tried to find\nout something about her; that is, had\nhad a letter written. She never learned\nto write herself. I suppose that hin-\ndered the letters getting off.\"\n\"You lived in Texas?\"\n\"Yes; near San Antonio. We lived\nthere seventeen years\u2014all my life up to\nthat time; ten years ago, as I said. My\nmother was a right young woman when\nshe died, not more than thirty-four.\nThat was her age as near as she could\ncalculate.\"\n\"If I find out anything more about\nyour family, I will let you know,\" I\nsaid, making another move. As I went\naway, I thought to myself, \"I believe I\nhave found dear old Nelly's lost 'Tilda;\"\nand I felt a throb of satisfaction, even if\nmother and daughter could never in\nthis life meet face to face.\nI stated my errand gradually to Mam-\nmy Nelly when I went to see her the\nnext day. I reminded her of our con-\nversation about her daughter. \"I\nthink I have found out something about\nher.\"\n\"Are she a-libin'?\" asked the old wo-\nman, eagerly.\n\"I think not, unless I am all wrong,\"\nI answered, gently.\n\"I cud hardly hab expected it,\" she\nsaid, shaking her head sadly. \"Forty\nyears sence she war sol' away. Heaps\nob changes comes in forty years. But\nyou go on, honey. Tell me wat you\nhab heerd.\"\n\"I have seen the daughter of a wo-\nman whose name was Matilda Smith,\nand who was sold out of the Smith fam-\nily in Virginia into the Levere family in\nLouisiana.\"\n\"Dat mus' be my 'Tilda. Good\nLor'!\"\n\"So it seems to me. This Matolda\nSmith was set free by her master, and\nafterward married a man who was also\nfree, with whom she went to live in\nTexas, near San Antonio.\"\n\"It war near San Antonio dat I libed\nfour year, off an' on.\"\n\"How strange that is! You were so\nnear that you might almost have\ntouched each other, and never knew it.\"\nI could have wept to think of it\u2014the\njoy of meeting so close to them, and yet\nthey had not met! Where had their\nguardian angels been all those months?\n\"Afterward Matilda Smith died,\" I\nwent on. \"She left one daughter, who\nis living with her husband and child in\nPort Royal now. She is Mrs. Fitzwal-\nlter; her husband is a preacher. She\nhas her mother's picture, which looks\nextremely like you, Mammy Nelly.\nWould you like to see it?\"\n\"Indeed I wud, chile,\" the old wo-\nman answered, with trembling eager-\nness.\nI brought about an interview. The\nrelationship between Mrs. Fitzwalter\nand Mammy Nelly was established be-\nyond any reasonable doubt, and the\nmost cordial family relations were\nestablished. Mammy's whole heart\nwent out to her little great-grandson.\n\"My 'Tilda war on'y a trifle older when\nshe went away.\"\nI had occasion to interview Mr. Fitz-\nwalter on parochial matters about this\ntime. He alluded to the discovery of\nhis wife's kindred.\n\"It is a series of circumstances, so to\nspeak,\" he remarked. \"I could have\nwished my good mother-in-law had lived\nto see this day. Instead of which, she\nhas departed to the blush unseen.\"\nShades of the poet Gray! -- Harper's\nWeeekly.\n",

      "text": "Charles Stewart Parnell was arrested\nat Morrison\u2019s Hotel, in Dublin, early\nThursday morning on two warrants\nsigned by Mr. Forster, Chief Secretary\nfor Ireland. One warrant charges him with\ninciting the intimidation of tenants\nfrom paying rent justly due, and the\nother with intimidating tenants from\ntaking the benefit of the Land act, by\napplying to the Land Commission to fix\na fair rent. Mr. Parnell was taken to\nKilmainham jail. His arrest has created\ngreat excitement.\nHis arrest was determined on at a pro-\nlonged session of the Cabinet Council,\nat which all the members of the Council\nexcept Lord Selborne were present.\nSince Mr. Gladstone\u2019s speeches at Leeds\nsome of the Ministerial journals in Lon-\ndon have been saying vaguely that im-\nmediate executive interference was nec-\nessary to make the Land act anything\nbut a dead letter. The arrest of Par-\nnell, however, was entirely unexpected.\nImmediately after the close of the Cabi-\nnet Council Secretary Forster left Lon-\ndon for Dublin, and upon his arrival\nthere by the morning mail at 8 o\u2019clock\nThursday, issued forthwith his warrants\nto the Dublin Detective Office. Mr Par-\nnell was stopping at Morrison\u2019s, and\nwas to take a morning train from the\nKingsbridge station to attend the con-\nvention of the Kildare Land and Labor\nLeague. One squad of detectives, fol-\nlowed by a considerable military force,\nwent into the railway station, where, a\ncrowd had gathered to see Mr. Parnell\noff. It was thought likely that he had\nalready boarded his train without at-\ntracting attention, and the crown sup-\nposed that the soldiers had been called\nout merely to preserve order.\nMeanwhile, under command of Detec-\ntive Superintendent Mallins, six detec-\ntives went to Morrison's hotel, which\nhad been carefully watched from the\ntime Mr. Parnell entered it last evening.\nAll were in citizen's clothes. Superin-\ntendent Mallins found that Parnell was\nstill in bed, and sent up word that he\nwould like to see him.Mr. Parnell re-\nturned a message that he would see the\nSuperintendent as soon as he was\ndressed, and presently word came down\nthat he was ready. Mallins took Detec-\ntive Sheridan up stairs with him. Mr. \nParnell received them pleasantly, and\nasked if he was to be arrested. Mallins\nhanded him one of the warrants. The\nink of Chief Secretary Forster's signa-\nture was not yet dry. Mallins suggested\nthat Mr. Parnell go with him quietly\nand immediately, so that there should\nbe no chance of a disturbance.\n\"All right,\" said Parnell, and put on\nhis hat. The two policemen escorted\nhim to the door, where a cab was wait-\ning for him. It was then half past nine.\nThe cab was driven directly to Kilmain-\nam prison, the other detectives follow-\ning in another carriage. Mr. Parnell\nwas warmly welcomed by the suspects in\nthe prison. Nobody at the hotel and\nnone of the bystanders on the street\nknew that Mr. Parnell was under arrest,\nand there was no demonstration of any\nkind. There was a good deal of excite-\nment, however, over the news when it\nbecame known, and the newspaper\noffices were besieged. On the chance of\na disturbance, the entire garrison of the\ncity is in barracks, held ready to march\nat any moment. It was reported that\nthe arrest of Parnell was only a prelimi-\nnary to still more vigorous action\nagainst the Land League. The Secre-\ntary of the League was interviewed\nshortly after the arrest. He expressed\nmuch astonishment at it, and exclaimed,\n\"Let them come on; we are ready for\nthem!\" Father Sheehy, Patrick Egan\nand V. B. Dillon went to Paris to-day.\nIt is believed that Parnell's speech at\nWexford Sunday furnished the Govern-\nment's technical justification for his ar-\nrest, which the Moderate Liberals and\nthe Conservatives approve.\nThe Land League Executive held a\nlong session Thursday at Morrison's.\nMessrs. John Dillon, Arthur O'Connor\nand A.M. Sullivan, members of Parlia-\nment, were present. Mr. Dillon made\na fiery speech, and it was proposed that\nthe League should issue an address. It\nis said that Mr. Dillon, who is M. P. for\nTipperary, will assume the Presidency\nof the League.\nMr. Dillon said at the meeting that it\nwas the most trying and critical moment\nin Ireland's history for a century. The\nstatement that Mr. Parnell had intimi-\ndated the people was false. He defied\nanybody to point to a single speech of\nMr. Parnell in favor of intimidation.\nHis arrest was due to private malice. It\nwas the duty of the nation to deal with\nthe matter coolly and with judgement,\nand to maintain the struggle within the\nlaw.\nAn additional guard and two nine-\npounders have been stationed in the\nupper Castle yard. The guard at Kil-\nmainham jail has been doubled. At a \nmeeting of the North Dublin Board of\nGuardians, Mr. Kenny, the medical\nofficers and medical attendant upon the\nsuspects in Kilmainham jail, stated that\nhe feared Mr. Kettle, the suspect, was\nthreatened with spinal disease, and that\nthere could not be the slightest doubt\nthat Mr. Kettle's symptoms were due to\nhis confinement. Mr. Kenny added\nthat he had reported to the Government\non the subject.\nThe inhabitants of Lismore closed\ntheir shops on the reception of the news\nof Mr. Parnell's arrest.\n",

A very pretty picture she\nmade, so her Brother Hal thought as he\npassed along the street in company with\nClay Whittle. Ivies were creeping above\nand around her head reaching after the\nsunlight, while lilies, geraniums, and hy-\nacinths were blooming at her feet.\nThe gentlemen passed on, as also did\nthe hands of the clock, but still Ethel sat\nin evident study. The room was furn-\nished with cultured taste, and skillful\nhands kept it looking very inviting to the\nfamily and their friends. It was library\nand sitting room combined. Ethel's\nparents had always striven to have their\nhome attractive, even if other expenses\nhad to be curtailed very closely.\nThe mother was an invalid and had been\nfor several weeks, and the willing hands\nand thoughtful heart of the mother were\nsadly missed by the daughter. The rest\nof the family said \"that Ethel took moth-\ner's place to them all so well, that for the\ntime they were not great losers,\" and the\nmother confined to her room for lack of\nstrength to be elsewhere, rather then from\nactual pain said \"that she was having a\nrest in mind and body, for Ethel did not\nneglect anything\" and she kept the little\nMother fresh and dainty, and the room so\nbright and cheery, that all the family\nwould gather around her in social glee.\nEthel would first notice mother's tired\nlook if they stayed too long, and pleasantly\nchiding them would drive them off to the\nsitting room. Clay Whittle used often to\ncome in with Hal to the mother's room,\nand these little visits were seasons of de-\nlight to him. His mother had passed the\nportals over into the other side. How he\nmissed her room and her counsel, and the\ntime spent over at the Bruces, were choice\nminutes and great helps to him.\nHis father was a leading politician, his\nsister a fashionable woman, while he him-\nself was a law student.\nThe evening before Clay and Ethel had\nattended an entertainment together and on\npassing out from it, she stopped a moment\nto speak to a friend and Clay was joined\nby his sister.\nClay she asked \"Why didn't you bring\nEva Dryton this evening.\"\n\"I prefer the company I have.\" he answered.\n\"Company good enough I dare say, but\nI like to see a girl with some style of\ndress. Everything she wears is a year\nold.\"\n\"Which of itself is a crime of the first\ndegree in the fashionable world\" he\nanswered : joined Ethel and passed on.\nSo on this the following morning, Ethel\nwas trying to study out some plans for\nnew clothes. Of course she was indig-\nnant over the remark, but it was true that\nall she had, was a year old, but she had\nfelt that they were good enough, until\nnow. She knew too, that all they had to\nlive upon was her father's salary, which\nmight have seemed large to many, but\ntheir expenses were correspondingly large,\nand with mother's sickness and Tom's\ncollege bills, or a part of them, somebody\nhad to economize and really deny them-\nselves, and she had felt willing, and even\nanxious to do her share; but after over-\nhearing the remark of the night before,\ndenying herself had not been so sweet.\nShe examined the closets to see if there\nwas anything available to be made over,\nbut returned to her low rocker disheart-\nened. Her father came in, and seeing\nsomething amiss, asked, \"What are your\nthoughts like, daughter, and what are\nyour wishes? Speak, and if half of the\nkingdom is desired, it shall be yours!\"\n\"I thought I was queen of the realm,\nand mistress of all I survey. I desire no\nmore than the home kingdom, with a robe\nof royal purple.\"\n\"Or some other fashionable shade,\" he \nsaid. \"Frankly, Ethel, what were you\nthinking about?\"\n\"I was wondering if there was any sur-\nplus money in the family treasury, that I\ncould use for myself,\" she said.\n\"I think about forty dollars. Would it\nhelp you?\"\n\"Yes, indeed. Just the sum I want.\"\nThe father seemed to hesitate. Ethel\nspoke quickly, \"I do not want it if it is\nneeded elsewhere.\"\n\"I'll let you know at tea-time,\" he said.\n\"Will balance accounts for the month, and\nrest assured, you shall have it, daughter,\nif father can spare it,\" and seated on one\nknew with her arm twined around his\nneck, she stroked his manly beard, ca-\nressingly.\n\"We are not rich, Ethel.\" he said, \"but\nthis home is ours, and is a very pleasant,\nand an attractive one, and I have a family\nof whom I am both proud and thankful.\nThere is one thing upon which I congrat-\nulate myself every week of my life, and\nit is this\u2014that there are no unexpected\nbills coming in for payment contracted by\nmy family. I know that they never buy\nwithout my advice and counsel, and\nthen order the bill sent home. At the end of\nthe month I come out even, at least. Here\nis an incident which struck me forcibly,\nbut is only one among the many of my\nexperience. As I passed through the\nstore one day, I saw Mrs. Drayton and\nEva buying goods. The bill was brought\nto my desk, copied and 'please remit'\nadded, as is our custom, and placed in an\nenvelope to be handed to parties or mailed\nOpportunity for giving it to Mr. Drayton\noccurred on my way to dinner. He open-\ned it, glanced at the total, and looked very\nmuch disturbed.\"\n\"Was it large?\" asked Ethel.\n\"Something over an hundred dollars\"\n\"Inside of thirty days will answer?\"\nhe asked.\n\"'Yes,' I answered and passed on. The \ntime has expired and no payment yet.\"\n\"He is very able to pay it!\" exclaimed\nEthel.\n\"Perhaps no more so than your father\nEthel; and several such bills coming\nunexpectedly soon seriously embarrass\n[Continued on fourth page.",

      "text": "The Huntington Herald announces\nthat the Mable has made a \"success-\nful\" trip to Ballard's Landing and\nreturn and has fully demonstrated\nthe easy navigability of the Snake by\ngoing down empty, coming back\nempty, bending an eccentric, break-\ning down feed pump (which gener-\nally is caused by failure of engine to\nfurnish sufficient steam), displaying\nan insufficient coaling capacity, the\nneed of a new wheel and a steam\ncapstan, not to speak of hanging up\non rocks, and placid condition of\nriver. But the Herald's account\nway as well be given:\nThe Steamer Mable returned to Gray's\nLanding on Monday, the 14th inst, at 3\no'clock, from her trial trip down to Bal-\nlards Landing. On this trip she demon-\nstrated beyond question her ability to\nnavigate the Snake between these points\nThe trip down was made in five hours\nand twenty minutes. The return trip\noccupied about thirty-six hours, delay be-\ning caused by the bending down of the feed\npump, and a shortage of coal, which\nnecessitated the making of steam by the\ngathering of drift-wood wherever it could\nbe found along the shore. She had but\nthree tons of coal aboard in the bunkers\nwhen she started down the river.\nIt was demonstrated that the steamer\nhad plenty of power in her to come over\nmost of the rapids. There are three rap-\nids which will always probably, have to\nbe \"lined\" over, that is, a rope taken\nashore and the boat assisted over the rap-\nids by her steam capstan. It is believed\nshe will make the round trip in two days.\nLeaving Gray's Landing early in the\nmorning she will make the run down to\nBallard's Landing in four hours. Taking\non her load she will start on her return\ntrip, tying up when night overtakes her.\nShe will thus make Gray's Landing, her \nstarting point, easily on the following day.\nThe wheel had but twelve-inch blades\nor buckets on this trip, which was found\nto be a defect. The blades will be in-\ncreased to eighteen inches and the steam\ncapstan placed in position before making\nanother trip. The first trip was made\nwith a hand capstan because of the fact\nthat a portion of the steam capstan had\nbeen lost enroute to Huntington.\nIt certainly doesn't take much to\nconstitute success if the above is ev-\nidence of it. The boat was \"built\nby the best experts\" but some changes\nare necessary, and the continued at-\ntempt at solution of the puzzle will\nbe watched with interest. The Her-\nald has one typographical error, how-\never in stating the boat went down\nto Ballard's Landing. Our informa-\ntion (pretty good) is to the effect that\nthe Mable only went as far as Oxbow,\n15 miles this side of Ballard's.\nThere is some bad water there that\nit did not attempt to pass. It would\nbe a good idea to incorporate a rail-\nway company to build a 15 mile con-\nnection between Ballard's Landing\nand Oxbow. In reading the Herald\naccount, remember it was but a few\nweeks ago that it stated the river from\nBay Horse down to be as \"placid as\nthe Willamette.\" The final sum-\nming up of the enterprise must be,\nthat if the pitiful methods of trans-\nportation indicated by the above ex-\ntract from the Herald are sufficient\nto handle the Seven Devils Copper\ncamp\u2014then the Seven Devils Copper\ncamp is a pitiful humbug, is not\nwhat it has been proclaimed to be,\ndoes not justify large investments of\ncapital and has no magnitude what-\never as a resource. The camp is a \nfizzle if such abortionate facilities\nare competent to operate it.\nTHE SIGNAL has heard it reported\nthat Captain Baughman, after making\nthe trip to Oxbow and return in the \nMable, has pronounced navigation a\nfailure. This much could have been\nlearned by the Navigation people at\nless expense by consulting the cap-\ntainw ho took down the Norma. We\nnotice by the Lewiston Tribune that\nCaptain Baughman returned to Lew-\niston, took his family and has gone\n",

It contains\nbetween 4000 and 5000 square miles, being 100 miles long and averaging 40 to 50\nmiles in width. Its resources are so varied and harmonious with each other as to\nmake it capable of living within itself if a Chinese wall were built around its boun-\ndaries. It has Mineral, Ruthburg, Seven Devils, Horse Mountain, Carbonate Hill,\nSummer Camp, Hilderbrand and other districts, bearing all kinds of mineral which\nfurnish a field for the prospector but it is not prospecting so much as money that is\nneeded by our mining districts. The Lumberman will find a great field here for saw\nmill business whenever we get better means of transportation. The grazer will find\nmiles of rolling hills covered with luxuriant bunch grass on which to range his stock.\nThe agriculturist will find a dozen beautiful portions of the county waiting to offer\nhim a home. Most southerly is Weiser valley; going northward comes Mann creek.\nMiddle valley, Salubria valley, Indian valley, Council valley, Hornet creek and\nSalmon Meadows.* To the east is the fine Crane creek country. All of these locali-\nties offer valuable inducements to the settler, varying slightly in their particular\nadaptability to agriculture. This is a good county for energetic and industrious\nhomeseekers, but not for drones. We need capital for the development of a dozen\nfine resources which will yield immense profits for the money invested.\n* Further information regarding these localities will be obtained in correspondence from them\nwhich will from time to time appear in the SIGNAL.\n",

The Oregon Short Line is our only railroad, which gives us full\ncommunication with the outside world, but places us at some disadvantage in regard\nto transportation rates. Surrounding Weiser, within a radius of ten miles, is 40,000\nto 50,000 acres of the finest agricultural and fruit land in the world. Unimproved\nland is covered with sage brush and unhandsome to look at, but cleared and culti-\nvated it is the richest soil on earth and grows fruit absolutely unexcelled in size,\nflavor and prolificacy. Land is going in to commercial orchards on all sides which\nfurnish avenues for investment which promise (and can and has been demonstrated)\nimmense returns. Weiser offers a fine location for various manufactories-a woolen\nmill especially there being a local product of 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 pounds of raw\nwool within 200 miles of Weiser, and the fact that transportation on this will be\nsaved is an important item. Weiser is the natural and only commercial railway\npoint for a country 150 miles north. A country equally extensive to the west and\nsouth in Oregon now furnishes considerable trade and a free bridge over Snake river\nwould give Weiser complete command over that section.

Press and pulpit have vied\nwith each other in eulogizing the matchless wo-\nman while countless friends of every tongue and\nnation have voiced their love and admiration be-\ntween their sobs.\nSo much has been said, and perfectly said, that\nany word of mine must seem peurile, indeed.\nHow shall the lesser express the greater? The\nmost that any of us can hope to do, is to throw a\nlittle light on one side of this many sided\n\u201creen.\u201d A greater than she must come before\nthis large-souled woman, with her steadfast pur-\npose and limitless resource, can be fully revealed\nto the world.\nAt first I thought to speak of her as an edu-\ncator, which she was from first to last, in the\nhighest, truest sense, but when I read the motto\nin the church this morning, I thought the phrase\nthat best expresses Miss Willard is \u201cThe Ideal\nCitizen,\u201d since she was true in every relation in\nlife and to all the world, and could say with\nPaul, \u201cMy citizenship is in heaven.\u201d\nHow diligent she was in obeying the apostolic\ninjunction to add to her faith virtue, and her\nvirtue knowledge, and to her knowledge temper-\nance, and to her temperance patience, and to\nher patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly\nkindness, and to brotherly kindness charity, the\nfruits of the spirit manifest in her life fully attest.\nWomanhood has its chivalry not less than\nmanhood, and Francis Willard was the Bayard\nof her sex, a knight without fear and without re-\nproach. Wherever a wrong was to be righted\nthere was she a leader in the conflict ready to die\nif need be for her King and humanity.\nIt was the suffering of women, she declared,\nwhich first gave her courage to speak in public,\nand she broke her lance in their behalf to such\npurpose that the editor of the Literary Digest has\nsaid: \u201cShe has probably done more than any\nother person to bring her sex to a realization of\ntheir own powers.\u201d\nTo me, the secret of her phenominal success\nseems to have been a rare combination of strong\nindividuality and a clear comprehension of the\nvalue of organization. One or two instances re-\ncorded since her death serve to illustrate my\npoint. In perfect obedience to her father\u2019s\nsweeping condemnation of the entire realm of\nfiction. She denied herself the companionship\nof cherished authors until the day of her major-\nity, when she began Ivanhoe and declared her\nindependence in the following characteristic \nwords, \u201cI am eighteen. I am of age. I am now\nto do what I think is right, and to read this fine\nhistorical story is, in my opinion, a right thing\nfor me to do.\u201d\nShe was a suffragist from childhood, when \u201cthe\nWillard children played at organization,\u201d found-\ning and governing cities and conducting clubs.\nShe wrote in her journal of her brother\u2019s first\nelection day, of how proud he looked as he drove\noff to the polls. \u201cI felt a lump in my throat. I\nturned to Mary and she, too, seemed wonderfully\nsober. I said: \u2018Wouldn\u2019t you like to vote as well\nas Oliver? Don\u2019t you and I love the country just\nas well as he, and doesn;t the country need our\nballots?\u2019\u201d Then mary looked scared but an-\nswered. \u201c\u2018Course we do and course we ought but\ndon\u2019t you go ahead and say so, for then we would\nbe called strong minded.\u201d\nBefore leaving school she was already a social\npower, so when she was elected president of the\nEvanston College for Ladies\u2014the first woman to\nbe elected president of a college\u2014no one was\nsurprised at the tact, skill and power which she\nevinced in molding and transforming the char-\nacter of her pupils.\nWhen the call came to join the temperance\ncrusade, all her friends dissuaded her-all save\none, Mrs. Livermore, her kindred spirit. Even to\n\u201cher intreped mother\u201d the step seemed, what too\nmany made it, the narrowing of life to one point\nof view. But she trusted the voice that called\nher and saw only an open door to a larger field of\neducation.\nTo her the dearest word on earth was home, but\nwith the courage and self-denial of the true her-\noine, she steadfastly put behind her all that she\nheld most dear to woman, that she might help\nthe world to realize the ideal home, which shall\ncreate a new earth when women become free and\nmen become strong and pure. To this end she\nlabored and gave her life daily to the suffrage\ncause, to the temperance cause, and to the move-\nment for social purity. With unerring vision she\nsaw that these three were one, and that together\nthey were ushering in the new era.\nShe was essentially a womanly woman, as all\nagree. Says a New York clergyman of her: \u201cOne\nlistened to the orator but saw only the woman.\u201d\nHer favorite phrase was, \u201cThe world needs moth-\nering.\u201d The temperance organization, magnifi-\ncent as it is in scope and service, was to its\nleader but a means to the larger end she had in\nview of purifying and idealizing the home and\nso mothering the world in the truest sense.\nNo party or sect could confine the broad cath-\nolic soul within its limits. Party, by its very\nname, means part of the whole, but her interests\nwere as broad as humanity and as deep as life.\nThe motive and logic of Miss Willards affilia-\ntion with the Prohibitionists, which resulted in\ndisaffection and the formation of a faction in the\nW. C. T. U., have been so well set forth by Mr.\nLee that no words of mine are needed. Suffice it\nto say, that in the crisis, as always, the elect\nleader proved herself the consummate general.\nBecause her eye was single, the whole body was\nfull of light; and with the statesmanship of\nwhich a great man said, no political president\ndared to put so much in his messages, she kept\nthe greatest organization in the world from ship-\nwreck, while the fragment, mis-named non-par-\ntisan, floated off and resolved itself into petty\nclubs subject to the Republican party which does\nnot yet recognize their political existence.\nFrances Willard had long been hailed as queen,\nbut through her enemies she won the crown of\nsainthood, and today all the world bows in rev-\nerence before the woman, who, under the strongest\nprovocation to resentment, could voice her heart\ninn the words of the martyred Lincoln, \u201cWith\nmalice to none and with charity for all.\u201d\nAs has been well said by the father of another\ngreat organization, \u201cto have known this true\nwoman was inspiration, to have had her for years\nat the head of a great cause was a benediction.\u201d\n",

Our baggage and freight will be\nsent here this afternoon when the tide\ncomes in, the water being too shallow at\nlow tide for boats to land. Our voyage\nfrom Portland was rough. After leaving\nAstoria on Feb. 14th, on the ship Oregon,\nwe went over the bar and 27 miles out\nat sea when it was discovered that the\nboat was on fire, but we put back to Asto-\nria without serious accident, and the fire\nwas extinguished, and on the 15th we put\nto sea again. Rounded cape Flattery in a\nterrible gale, and of the 550 passengers on\nboard only about 50 of them remained on\ndeck, and some thought they had swal-\nlowed a whale. Barometer went lower\nand wind higher up to the 19th. We cast\nanchor at Juneau in the most terrific gale\never witnessed in these waters. We drug\nanchor and went ashore on a bar off\nDouglas Island only a few hundred feet\nfrom the great Treadwell mill. When the\ntide went out it left the vessel high and\ndry, some of the passengers climbing\ndown the sides of the vessel and walking\nall around it. There was danger of the\nvessel turning over as the deck stood at\nan angle of 38 degrees. We laid in this\nstate over 30 hours, and then by the help\nof the passengers, the hand of providence\nand high tide we got the ship afloat to all\nappearances in good safe condition. Bal-\nance of the journey was made in a gale to\nSkagua\u201410 days in all from Portland.\nThe weather is cold and dry, snow deep\nenough for good bob sleighing. There\nare lots of teams here and the best aver-\nage lot of horses I ever saw and all seem\nto have plenty to do hauling miners\nfreight from here to Sheep camp a distance\nof 15 miles, and are making from $15 to\n$20 per day. I don't know whether they\nget steady work or not. I have not de-\ntermined yet what course I will pursue.\nThe Canadian government is refusing to\nallow any one to go into the interior with-\nout 1093 pounds of actual provisons.\nThe duty on goods going in varies accord-\ning to the articles but will average 35\nper cent of first cost.

It is likely that the\ncourt will take a further adjournment.\nAttorney Duprey, the leading counsel\nfor the defense, is confined to his bed with\nrheumatism, and his associates will base\nthis as a reason for continuance for sev-\neral days. Although the court is known\nto be opposed to delays in this trial, it is\nbelieved, however, that he will grant the\ncontinuance. In that case the trial will\nnot likely be resumed before next Monday.\nIn the meantime Theodore Durant re-\nmains in his cell, never leaving it for the\ncustomary exercising in the corridors. It\nis said that he is becoming exceedingly\nirritable. Since he finished his testimony\nin Judge Murphy's court the defendant\nhas lost considerable vivacity, and instead\nof being careless and indifferent he is se-\nrious and troubled.\nFor the first time since his arrest the\nmedical student seemed impressed with\nthe proper idea of his terrible position.\nAt last it has dawned on him that he\nmay be convicted, and as he realizes the\nchain of circumstances against him he\nhas become much depressed. Attorney\nDickinson, for Durant, remarked that he\nthought the defense would be able to put\nin the balance of its testimony in two\ndays or less. Then the prosecution will\nput its witnesses in rebuttal. District At-\ntorney Barnes says he will handle them\nrapidly, but Dickinson is preparing to\ncross question witnesses at length, and on\nthat account it need create no surprise if\nanother week is devoted to the work of\ntaking testimony.\nAlthough Captain of Detectives Lees is\nbusily engaged in the trial of Durant for\nthe murder of Blanche Lamont, he is not\noverlooking the Minnie Williams case,\nbut is still gathering evidence to be used\nwhen the trial of that case is begun.\nMany think that in the event the prisoner\nis convicted of the killing of Blanche La-\nmont he will not be put on trial for the\nmurder of Minnie Williams. Captain\nLees and the district attorney have made\nup their minds, however, to press both\ncases. Just how soon the second trial will\nbegin has not been determined, as a date\nfor the hearing has not been set.\n",

      "text": "Information Received at Washington by\nJapanese Minister Regarding the Disap-\npearance and Probable Death of the\nQueen\u2014Korean Legation Think Her Dead.\nWASHINGTON, Oct. 15.\u2014Information of\nthe formidable uprising in Korea, result-\ning in the disappearance and probable\ndeath of the queen and the landing of\nmilitary forces by the United States and\nEuropean powers, has been received by\nMinister Kurino of Japan from the for-\neign office at Tokyo. It is quite sensa-\ntional, indicating the landing of marines\nby Russia, the United States and probably\nGreat Britain.\nThe latest dispatch to Minister Kurino\nstates that a force of Russian marines, 40\nin number, has been landed. Thus far\nthey have confined themselves to guard-\ning the Russian legation at Seoul.\nUnited States marines were landed from\nthe Yorktown to the number of 16. It is\nbelieved also that British marines have\nbeen landed. Besides these the Japanese\nhave a considerable force of soldiers at\nSeoul, who have been preserving order.\nThe dispatches come from Tokyo and\ncommunicate the substance of dispatches\nreceived from General Muira, the Japanese\nenvoy at Seoul. They are dated from the\n9th to the 12th inst. It appears in these\ndispatches that the trouble had its incep-\ntion through the queen's dislike of the\nnewly organized soldiery of Korea. The\nold soldiers had the primitive equipment\nof the far east, but with the progress of\nJapanese influence in Korea two battal-\nions of Korean troops were organized on\nmodern methods. Each battalion num-\nbered 600 men, armed with modern weap-\nons. They were well drilled and officered.\nTai Won Kun Leads the Antiroyal Forces.\nWhen the queen showed her disfavor to-\nward these new troops, they appealed to\nthe Tai Won Kun, a powerful chief, who\nhas long been at enmity with the queen.\nHe accepted the leadership of the new\ntroops, and at the head of one battalion\nentered the queen's palace. The native\nsoldiers fled from the palace. The Tokyo\ndispatches do not state specifically what\nbecame of the queen further than that she\nhas disappeared and cannot be located.\nThe officials are inclined to believe, how-\never, that the unofficial reports of the\nqueen's death are true.\nThe Japanese government, the dis-\npatches further state, has acted quickly\non the reports and has appointed a com-\nmission to inquire into the facts. In the\nmeantime it is emphatically denied that\nthe queen's death, if it has occurred, was\ndue to the Japanese. One report is that\na Japanese Soshi killed the queen. This\nis not yet confirmed in the dispatches re-\nceived here. The officials say that the\nSoshi are an irresponsible and lawless\nclass, and that their acts cannot be laid to\nthe Japanese people or government.\nGeneral Muira's reports also cover the\nwork of Japanese troops in preserving or-\nder. These troops were stationed opposite\nthe palace, having secured this point of \nvantage some time since through the Ko-\nrean government. They took no part in\nthe attack on the palace, but after it had\noccurred, when the native troops were\nfleeing and the new battalions were en-\nforcing their success in capturing the pal-\nace, the Japanese troops aided in prevent-\ning bloodshed and disorder. It is probable\nthat some deaths occurred during the me-\nlee. Following this came the landing of\nUnited States and Russian marines, and,\nas is believed, the landing of the British.\nPrince Pak Likely to Rule Korea.\nThe latest indications are that the Tal\nWou Kun and the king are in control of\naffairs at the Korean capital. The king\nhas been the nominal ruler, but the queen\nhas heretofore been recognized as the real\nruler. The influence of the king and the\nTai Won Kun are distinctly favorable to\nthe Japanese.\nAt the Korean legation no word has\nbeen received from the disturbed capital.\nThe officials are much exercised and do not\ndoubt that the queen has met her death,\nalthough they are not ready to abandon\nhope. In case official confirmation is re-\nceived there will be such formal ceremony\nas is usual on the death of a sovereign.\nThe legation will go into mourning, but\nthere is not likely to be a funeral service,\nalthough this has been considered as a\nfurther mark of respect.\nRecent news from Korea makes Prince\nPak, lately prime minister of that coun-\ntry, the central figure of interest in Wash-\nington. He has been here for the last few\nweeks and is impatiently awaiting an ex-\npected summons from the members of the\nprogressive party, of which he is the lead-\ner, asking him to return and resume his\nmission of reforming the government. He\nis likely to be the future ruler of Korea.",

The material of\nhe first two stories is Potsdam red sand-\ntone. The upper stories are faced with\nld gold Pompeian brick trimmed with\npeckled terra cotta. The parlors are\nhandsomely furnished and it is the in-\nention to have them open every day and\nevening for members. When finished\nhe building will have cost over $100,000,\nnd it is an ornament to the city.\nThe Local Lodges.\nFifty years ago, on July 1, 1845, the\nfirst lodge of Odd Fellows in Waterbury,\nNosahogan, was organized with thirteen\nmembers. The records show that for a\nlong time it required the hardest kind of\nwork to make the lodge self-sustaining.\nFor ten years there was a gradual in-\nrease in membership, but the following\ndecade was filled with trials. The mem-\nbership decreased annually until 1865,\nwhen the tide turned and the member-\nship continually increased, until to-day,\nold Nosahogan, with a membership of\n55, is the banner lodge in Connecticut.\nThe total number admitted to member-\nship since the lodge was organized was\n1,098. During the half century the total\namount paid for relief was $40,624.69.\nTownsend lodge was organized on\nJanuary 1, 1872, and has a membership\nof 357. It has distributed $12,630.50 for\nhe relief of its members and their fam-\nlies.\nOn September 20, 1853, Ansantawae\nencampment, No 20, was organized. It \nhas a membership of three hundred.\nRebekah lodge, I. O. O. F., composed\nlargely of the wives, daughters and sis-\nters of Oddfellows, was organized on\nJune 15, 1892, with sixty-one members.\nIt now has a membership of 128; forty-\nnine brothers and seventy-nine sisters.\nCanton T. R. Martin was organized as\na uniformed branch of the order in this\ncity on May 30, 1893. It had an original\nmembership of twenty-six, which has\nbeen increased to over one hundred.\nOther additions to the local lodges\nwere the Nosahogan Aid association, or-\nganized on May 4, 1884, having a mem-\nbership at present of 240, and the Nosa-\nhogan Piscatorial association, a body of\ngood fellows, organized on August\n17, 1887.\nMuch of the success of the day's ex-\nercises is due to the hard working com-\nmittees. F. E. Cross was chairman of\nthe committee of arrangement and F. W.\nTate, secretary and treasurer, the other\nmembers being J. C. Moore, C. F. Trott,\nG. Fred Barnes, R. E. Colby, D. L.\nDickinson, F. K. Woolworth, H. E.\nLivingstone, A. H. Osborne and J. H.\nPilling.\nThe dedication ceremonies will take\nplace this evening. There will be an ad-\ndress of welcome by Past Master George\nH. Cowell. The dedication ceremony\nprescribed on the Oddfellows' book of\nceremonies will be used. F. E. Cross,\nchairman of the building committee, or\nGeorge H.

F., of Connecticut, was\nheld in the Masonic temple at 11 o'clock.\nGrand Patriarch William H. Tyler of\nMeriden reported the order in a flour-\nishing condition. These officers were\nelected: Grand patriarch, Dumond P.\nMerwin, Milford; grand high priest, \nGeorge W. Camp, Bridgeport; grand\nsecretary, Frederick Botsford, New Ha-\nven; treasurer, J. W.

A\ntelegram was sent by the governor to\nBrigadier General John A. Taylor of For-\nrest City of the Arkansas state guard\nsummoning him to a conference at once.\nThe meaning of the conference is that the\ngovernor desires to acquaint himself with\nthe available strength of the state militia,\nso that he may act knowingly if the situa-\ntion at Hot Springs reaches a crisis\nwhere the services of the militia may be re-\nquired.\nGeneral Taylor is expected to arrive to-\nday and consult with the governor.\nAccording to the offers contained in\ntelegrams and letters received at the ex-\necutive office, Governor Clark estimates\nthat the services of 10,000 men are at his\ndisposal for the purpose of putting down\nthe fight if needed. These offers come\nfrom all parts of the state.\nClark Determined to Prevent the Fight.\nA vigorous determination to prevent\nthe fight is plainly discernable in the sig-\nnificant proceedings at the executive office.\nIndeed Governor Clark was more emphat-\nic than ever in saying that the fight would\nnot be allowed to come off in Arkansas.\nHe goes so far as to say that if the affair\noccurs as advertised at Hot Springs he\nwould resign and try to find an office that\nhe could run. The governor says Corbett\nand Fitzsimmons have been warned, and\nif they now arrive at Hot Springs bent on\nthe mission of fighting their presence in\nthe city or county will be considered an\novert act and will be treated accordingly.\nThe governor says he will do everything\nwithin the scope of his power to prevent\nthe big mill. He says that he realizes that\nHot Springs is anxious to retrieve its past\nmisfortunes, and he would like to help\nthe city, but in this instance his duty is\nplain, and he will use his utmost dili-\ngence and power to do what it is his duty\nto do. He would not like to put the state\nto the expense of sending several compa-\nnies of the state militia to Hot Springs,\nand he hopes the principals and their\nbackers in the proposed fight, together\nwith all parties concerned or interested,\nwill not impose the necessity of ordering\nthe militia to the scene in order to stop\nthe fight. Concluding his interview, Gov-\nernor Clark said he did not want to see\nany blood shed as a result of the pugilists'\nrefusal to refrain from making prepara-\ntions to fight. He sincerely hoped that it\nwould be avoided.\n\"I am neither seeking nor slighting any\nresponsibility in this matter,\" he contin-\nued, \"and will do my duty.\"\nWhen questioned in reference to the\nproposition to change the affair into a\nglove contest, Governor Clark said that\nhe could make no distinction between a\nglove contest and a prize fight. It was a\nprize fight no matter what it was called.",

      "text": "HOT SPRINGS, Ark., Oct. 15\u2014The law\nwill soon be appealed to decide whether\na scientific contest between skilled boxers\nwith soft gloves will be a violation of its\nprovisions in the state of Arkansas.\nManager Vendig said: \"We have not\ncome to Arkansas and the city of Hot\nSprings with any purpose to violate its\nlaws. If Mr. Corbett and Mr. Fitzsim-\nmons cannot come to this city and give\nsuch an exhibition as is provided for in\nour article of agreement as they now\nstand\u2014a limited number of rounds with\nsoft gloves, the authorized officers being\nempowered to stop the exhibition if it be-\ncomes brutal\u2014then the exhibition will\nsurely not take place in Hot Springs. The\nbest authority at our service says that\nthis will be no violation of the laws of the\nstate, but to make ourselves absolutely\nsafe the citizens' committee has engaged\nthe best representatives of the legal pro-\nfession in Arkansas, and they are looking\ndiligently into the matter at this time.\nWe shall have a decision from them by to-\nmorrow, and upon their advice we shall\nact. The matter will be brought into the\ncourts as soon as we can get it there. If\nwe cannot have the fight here, we have an\nabsolute guarantee of protection from\nthree different places in Mexico\u2014one of\nthem just across the Rio Grande from El\nPaso. Until we know just where we\nstand legally in this matter here we shall\ndo nothing.\"\nThe ministers called a meeting at the\nCentral Methodist church, and quite a\ncrowd gathered. William A. Brady, Cor-\nbett's manager, was present and asked if\na representative of Mr. Corbett might be\npermitted to have a few words. There\nwere a few subdued expressions of dissent,\nbut calls to \"Speak! Speak!\" began to\nfill the room, and Mr. Brady was permit-\nted to talk. Mr. Brady's talk captured\nthe house, and when he finished such an\nacclamation of cheers and handclapping\nwent up as was never before seen or heard\nin that sacred edifice.

      "text": "Thousands of Visitors From all Over\nNew England Royally Entertained\nBeautiful Decorations, Excellent Music\nand a Big Parade\u2014Dedication of the\nNew Building and Anniversary Bal\nThis Evening.\nThe Oddfellows of Waterbury were not\nvery fortunate in their selection of a day\nfor the observance of the fiftieth anni\nversary of the introduction of the order\nin this city, and the dedication of their\nbeautiful new home. Nature was un-\nkind and the weather was not all that\ncould have been desired. The visitors\ncame by every train and\nthe committees were very early\nabroad providing for the comfort\nof their guests. It was an immense un-\ndertaking to provide for the thousands\nwho visited the city, but\nevery detail had been arranged\nto a nicety and the procedings were\nmarked with the best of order. If any\nof our guests have been overlooked,\nslighted or treated ungraciously the fault\nwas not of the heart, for Waterbury\ntried to outdo itself on this occasion,\npeople of all classes co-operating with\nthe committee to make the affair a suc-\ncess.\nIt is estimated that there are four\nthousand Oddfellows in the city and\nhundreds of visitors have been coming\nin by train and trolley cars. The fact\nthat it is a legal holiday, created by the\nlate session of the general assembly in\nhonor of the martyred president, Lin-\ncoln, added to the interest in the exer-\ncises and undoubtedly increased the \ncrowds, it being an idle day in many\nplaces. The factories, schools and\nbusiness houses are closed, and alto-\ngether it is the greatest celebration Wa-\nterbury has ever witnessed.\nDespite the immense crowds on the\nstreet good order was maintained. Tele-\ngrams were received by the local author-\nities from Boston, New York, Springfield\nand Hartford that many pickpockets and\nsneak thieves had left for Waterbury.\nIt was also said that the city was over-\nrun with lewd women, but up to 3\no'clock no complaints had been made to\nthe police.\nThe center of attraction was the visit-\ning Rebekas, 400 in number. The\nMeriden members paraded behind the\nband from the depot. They held a\nmeeting in the Scovill house late this\nafternoon. The Meriden encampment\nacted as escort to the grand patriarch.\nThe Decorations.\nThe decorations were the most general\nand artistic ever seen in the city. Pri-\nvate residences vied with business houses\nin an effort to outdo each other, with the\nresult that almost every building in the\ncenter and many on the outskirts, too,\nwere resplendent with flags, bunting,\nand bannerettes of every description. The\nvisiting Oddfellows must have been led\nto believe, when looking at the different\nbuildings, that their brethren in Water-\nbury owned the town. And they were\nright, for the place was theirs for to-\nday. Some of the decorations were a\nlittle amusing and caused the uninitiated\nto believe that those hanging them out\nmeant to give offense to the order, but\nthis was not the case, as those conver-\nsant with the mysteries of the order can\nattest. At the residence of J. B.\nWells on Livery street, within easy view\nof the visitors as they proceeded from\nthe New England depot, a banner was\nhung out with the picture of a jackass\npainted among reading matter so that it\nread, \"Nosahogan's Jackass Welcomes\nYou.\" An unique emblem was set out\nat the rooms of the Wheel club on North\nMain street, consisting of three bicycle\ntires arranged so as to give an excellent\nrepresentation of the triple links. A\nhuge banner marked \"Welcome,\" sus-\npended across the street from the Wel-\nton fountain to Irvin bloc, met the\neye of all who could crowd themselves\ninto Exchange place, and one of the same\ndesign was stretched from from above\nthe entrance to the City hall to one of\nthe elms in the green. The latter\nwas handsomely decorated with the\ntriple links with the letters \"F. L. T.\"\nneatly arranged in the links. When all\nare in the superlative degree it is not\nnecessary to particularize; but no one\ncould help admiring the great efforts\nwhich were made to add to the majestic\nsplendor of the Apothecaries hall build-\ning and the Bohl block. The new Odd\nFellows hall, Irving block, Lilley block,\nG. A. R. hall, and in fact every business\nblock in the center was in holiday at-\ntire and the owners and occupants seemed\nto take a pride in the great artistic\ntriumphs. A noticeable feature of the\ndecorations was a fair sprinkling of\ngreen flags, which seemed to lend ad-\ndition alarm to the other colors. They\nwere the object of much attention. The\nrooms of the Catholic Literary associa-\ntion and St Joseph's T.A. society in the\nLilley block and the Elks rooms\nwere also splendidly decorated\nand a reference to this fact brought this\nremark from Alderman Cross, chairman\nof the committee of arrangements:\n\"While I am much pleased with the ef-\nforts of all classes of citizens to assist us\nin extending a warm welcome to our\nvisiting friends, still I am not much sur-\nprised at it. Oddfellowship is an in-\nstitution of toleration, and organizations\nfounded on this principle are sure to\nmerit the approval all true Americans\nregardless of class or creed.\" The Watch\nshop lot, where the guests were seated\nfor dinner, was a rare sight and the em-\nployes of the factory did themselves\nproud as waiters. Attired in their best\ncostumes, with handsome white aprons\nand natty headgear, no wonder the\nguests lingered about the tables as long\nas time would permit. The ivied walls\nof the factory presented an inviting as-\npect. Over one of the windows in\nthe third story the letters\n\"I. O. O. F,\" were artistically ar-\nranged. At the second story a big\n\"Welcome\" sign could be seen from all\nover the grounds, and over the main en-\ntrance the name of the factory was\nshown. The reviewing stand on West\nMain street and the various buildings in\nthat section also look gay in their\nfinery, all showing the touch\nof master hands. Lincoln's picture was\n",

Tur-\nner and Chief Engineer Thomas Rodd.\nMr. Turner escaped through a window.\nThe Pennsylvania special, to which\nspecial car No. 7505 was attached, was\nrunning rapidly between Hanna and\nDavis station, Indiana, when at 6 a.m.\nthe fire was discovered by Mr. Wood.\nMr. Wood signaled the train to stop,\nshouting an alarm to Messrs. Turner and\nRodd. The latter and Mr. Wood were\nnear the doors and escaped in extreme\nneglige as the train came to a stop.\nExit Blocked by Flames.\nMeanwhile Mr. Turner, occupying a\ncompartment near the center of the car,\naroused by the heat and the shouts of his\ncompanions, opened the corridor door only\nto find his exit blocked by the flames,\nwhich had been fanned to fury by\nthe rapid rate at which the train was\nmoving. He promptly turned to the\nwindow and smashed the glass with his\nfist, no other instrument being at hand,\nthe sash refusing to budge.\nThe train, however, was obeying Mr.\nWood's signal with prodigious jerks, which\nalarmed the entire passenger list, and\npresently came to a standstill at tower\nS. Here the train crew from the outside\nsucceeded in raising the sash, and Mr.\nTurner was assisted to safety with no\ninjury more serious than a slightly cut\nhand.\nSalvaged Their Clothes.\nThe crew likewise made salvage of the\nraiment in the burning car. The car was\nthen shunted onto a siding and left to\nburn.\nThe train pulled into Chicago minus\none car, but otherwise none the worse for\nthe experience.\nThe officials came west from Pittsburg\non a routine trip and stopped only a\nshort time in this city\u2014just long enough,\nin fact, to catch the first train back to\nPittsburg.\nThe fire is believed to have been due to\ncrossed electric wires, although there is a\npossibility that it started from a spark\nfrom the locomotive.\n",

      "text": "PARIS, May 7.\u2014Both public sympathy\nand the law seem today to be clearly\nagainst the Posts, Telegraphs and Tele-\nphones Employees Association, which yes-\nterday threw down the gage of battle to\nthe government by transforming itself\ninto a syndicate, or union, under the laws of 1884.\nThis would place the association on the\nsame footing as the workmen's unions.\nThe action was calculated to give it the\nright to strike against its employer, the\nstate.\nStrike Proposition Referred.\nThe congress of railroad men, at a\nsecret session held today,  decided to sub-\nmit the question of a general strike to a\nreferendum and appointed a permanent\nstrike commttee.\nDispatches received here from Havre.\nLyons and other cities say that the\nPosts, Telegraphs and Telephones Em-\nployes' Association has voted in principle\nfor a general strike.\nThe newspapers this morning, with the\nexception of the extreme socialist or-\ngans, are unsparing in their denunciation\nof the step taken by the association as\nan act of rebellion. They urge the gov-\nernment to proceed with energy and crush\nthe insurrection before the movement in-\ngulfs the other categories of state em-\nployes.\nFederation Directs Plan.\nEvidence accumulates today that the\nformation of this union yesterday was\nonly the first step in a far--reaching plan\nof the General Federation of Labor to\nplace the entire machinery of the gov-\nernment at its mercy.\nThe law of 1884 limits unions to pro-\nfessions and trades engaged in \"com-\npetitive industry.\" The attorney general\nof the republic is to decide summarily\nthat the \"syndicate\" is illegal and order\nits dissolution.\nAs soon as this is done the organizers\nof the movement will be subject to heavy\nfines and imprisonment if they persist in\nmeeting.\nThe issue between the \"syndicalists\"\nand the government has been sharply\ndrawn by yesterday's events. A general\nstrike is considered probable in the im-\nmediate future.\nGovernment Will Fight.\nThe government, which is preparing for\nthe threatened conflict, has caused the\nword to go out that it intends to gov-\nern.\nWhen the delegates of the various cat-\negories of employes in the bureau of posts\nand telegraphs visited the ministry of the\ninterior, where they expected to find Pre-\nmier Clemenceau, yesterday morning,\nthey were told that he was not in.\nThey bore a letter granting their request\nfor an audience. It is true, M. Clemen-\nceau has been ill for several weeks, but\nno explanation was made.\nWhat steps the disaffected employes will\ntake is not yet known. The day has been\nspent in perfecting their organization.\nThe government further defied its em-\nployes yesterday by suspending M. Pau-\nron, leader of the recent strike.\nUnder the personal direction of the\npremier and Minister of Labor Barthou\nenergetic measures have been taken\nagainst a walkout.\nTen thousand candidates for postal\nwork have been enrolled. Guards have\nbeen placed over the telegraph and tele-\nphone switchboards.\nAutomobils have been reserved. Sol-\ndiers have been trained for postal work.",

Mrs. Willard and the child wife\nwere on hand at the morgue long before\nthe hour appointed for the hearing to be-\ngin. A crowd of the curious was already\non hand.\n\"We only want to see the little wife,\"\nseveral female spectators admitted, and\ndisappeared after their curiosity had been\nsatisfied.\nThe child wife, dressed in white and\nwearing a hat trimmed with white lace\nand green vines, occupied a seat beside\nher mother, while her father sat at the\ntable with his counsel, T. C. Taylor. As-\nsistant United States Attorney Charles\nH. Turner was present with Detective\nMcNamee to look after the interests of\nthe prosecution, and when the hearing\nhad been concluded they took the state-\nments of several witnesses. On her way\nfrom the morgue Dorothy Beck stopped\nlong enough to recognize her father, but\nshowed no emotion.\nBeck Funeral Next Monday.\nUndertaker Thomas R. Nalley took\ncharge of the body of Beck this after-\nnoon and removed it from the morgue\nto his establishment, 1231 11th street\nsoutheast. Arrangements have been\nmade for the funeral to take place Mon-\nday afternoon at 2 o'clock. Interment\nwill be at Glenwood.\nProceedings at the Inquest.\nDr. Thomas A. Lee, assistant resident\nphysician at the Casualty Hospital, the\nfirst witness examined, testified that Beck\nwas brought to the hospital yesterday\nafternoon in the automobile of Thomas\nW. Smith. Beck was in a dying condi-\ntion, the result of three bullet wounds,\ntwo in the chest and one in the left side.\nDr. Wellington was summoned to the hos-\npital and the wounded man was placed on\nthe operating table. It was found that\none bullet had penetrated the liver of the\nwounded man, and that his life could not\nbe saved.\nSergt. Ryan of the fifth precinct testi-\nfied that he went to the scene of the\nshooting yesterday afternoon and found\na crowd on the sidewalk. Some of the\nmen in the crowd were holding Willard\ndown and witness told them to release\nhim. About that time he saw a man slip\na white-handled pistol to Capt. Williams.\n\"Have you the pistol?\" asked the coro-\nner.\n\"Yes, sir,\" responded the witness, turn-\ning over the weapon.\n\"Is it loaded?\"\n\"No, sir.\"\n\"Who unloaded it?\"\n\"Capt. Williams.\"\nThe coroner questioned Capt. Williams,\nwho said three chambers were empty\nwhen Adolph Arneson gave him the\nweapon. Arneson, fireman at the Penn-\nsylvania station, who testified that he\nwas acquainted with Beck, was on his\nway home yesterday when he saw Wil-\nlard come out of Lorenzo Simis' saloon\nat New Jersey avenue and N street. He\nhad heard of the trouble in the morning,\nand when he saw Willard go in the di-\nrection of the Beck store he followed.\nFollowed \"to See a Scrap.\"\nArneson said he thought there was\ngoing to be a scrap, but did not antici-\npate any shooting.\n\"When I got about half a square from\nthe store,\" said witness, \"I heard the\nshooting.\"\n\"Did you know Willard?\"\n\"Yes, sir. I have known him about\ntwo years.\"\nWitness said he saw Willard enter the\nstore, and also saw him when he came\nout with the pistol in his hand.\n\"A man named Jackson,\" witness stat-\ned, \"jumped on Willard and knocked the\nweapon out of his hand.\"\nThe men engaged in a wrestle. A col-\nlored man picked up the revolver and\nhanded it to witness.\n\"Is this the weapon?\" asked the cor-\noner, exhibiting the revolver.\n\"It is. It had two bullets in it.\"\nHoped He Was Dead.\nWitness held Willard until the police\ncame. Willard asked him if he thought\nBeck was dead, and he replied in the\naffirmative. Willard, he said, remarked:\n\"I hope to the Lord he is dead. If he is\ndead I feel happy, and if he ain't dead\nI don't feel happy.\"\nGilbert Jackson, employed as inspector\nfor the District, testified that he entered\nthe store of Beck about 12:40 o'clock yes-\nterday to buy a sandwich, and while there\nhe saw Beck and several relatives. He\nhad been in there seven or eight minutes,\nwhen Willard came in and said something\nwhich he did not understand.\n\"And,\" added witness, \"Then came\u2014\nbang, bang, bang!\"\nWillard fell from the steps and witness\nheld him until the police came. Willard\nwhile down, cried, \"If I killed him I'm\nthe happiest man in the world, and if I\ndidn't I'm the saddest.\"\nEdward Alfred Hoffman of 202 N street,\na clerk in the Beck store, testified that\nWillard entered the store and asked Mr.\nBeck about his (Willard's) daughter.\nBeck replied that Dorothy had told him\nshe would not return home.\n\"Where was Dorothy at that time?\"\n\"Up town. She was at 106 Indiana\navenue.\"\n\"Mother, Will I Die?\"\nWitness saw Willard fire one shot and\nhe (witness) ran from the store to the\nhouse. Two more shots were fired. Beck\nasked his mother if she thought he\nwould die, and she told him \"no.\" The\nwounded man, he said, also asked for his\nwife. He seemed to know no one in the\nhouse save his mother.\n\"What was Mr. Beck doing when the\nfirst shot was fired?\"\n\"He was weighing ginger snaps for a\nboy named Wilson.\"\nFred Zuschnitt, brother-in-law of the\ndead man, testified that when Willard en-\ntered the store he asked Beck \"What are\nyou going to do about it?\"\nBeck replied that Dorothy had said she\ndid not want to see him or have him",

But it soon pulled its head\nin, and inquiries began to fly, and now\nboth head and tail are out of sight.\nThere's something curious about it all,\nas would be natural with any first-class\nmystery.\nFor two days members of the Senate\ncommittee on judiciary have been drop-\nping in upon the President, by invitation\nfrom the chief executive. They have been\ndropping out as noiselessly as they knew\nhow. They have been turning down all\nquestions at the rate of 998 a minutes, at\nthe same time giving the tip that the\nPresident had put them under a special\ninhibition of confidence. This morning he\ntalked with Senators Culberson, Rayner,\nBacon and Paynter, democratic members\nof the committee. He saw Senator Over-\nman, another democrat, yesterday, and\nlikewise talked with Senators Clark, Dil-\nlingham, Piles, Warner and Borah, re-\npublicans. They all wore the solemn look\nthe democrats carried with them today.\nThe democrats asserted that the confer-\nence in no way related to political ques-\ntions, but further than that they stopped\nshort. The best information is that the\nmatter relates to a judgeship nominee\nwhose history is pretty well known to\nmembers of the committee and that the\nPresident does not desire to have any one\ndone an injustice by the talk that would\nfollow any publication of the matter.\nVarious Suggestions Offered.\nVarious suggestions were made during\nthe day as to possible legislative problems\nthe President wished to settle or have\ntaken up now. One was as to the commod-\nities clause provision of the Hepburn\nrailway rate law and the understood wish\nof the President that this be amended so\nas to prevent stock ownership by rail-\nroads in companies handling commodities\nreally belonging to the railroads. The im-\nprobability, however, to taking this up in\nadvance of the next session of Congress\nand the still greater improbability that\nthe committee could be brought together\nupon any problem of that kind at this\ntime dispels that theory.\nInvitations for the President.\nSenator Paynter of Kentucky asked the\nPresident today to attend the meeting of\nthe Kentucky Retail Grocers' Association\nat Frankfort the 12th of this month. The\nPresident said he was sorry he could\nnot go.\nAlvin Martin of Norfolk, republican na-\ntional committeeman of Virginia, asked\nthe President today if he would not be\nable to visit Norfolk in June, according\nto the invitation extended him by the\nboard of trade of that city. The President\nsaid he thought he would be able to run\ndown to Norfolk next month.\nNo Quarrel in the Cabinet.\nThe cabinet meeting today was a com-\nparatively short one. Secretaries Wilson\nand Ballinger were both asked about the\nalleged row between themselves and their\nrespective departments over the question\nof withdrawal of sites for forest ranges.\n\"It is made out of the whole cloth,\"\ndeclared Secretary Wilson. \"There is ab-\nsolutely no truth in the story.\"\nSecretary Ballinger said practically the\nsame thing, declaring that the basis of\nthe whole story had been a mere matter\nof administrative detail and interpreta-\ntion of law, which at no time threatened\nany unpleasant relations between himself\nand the head of the Department of Agri-\nculture.\nWants to Name Judge Willard.\nPresident Taft desires to name Charles\nA. Willard, a Minnesota man, as judge\nof the district court at Minneapolis, in\nplace of Judge Milton D. Purdy, resign-\ned. Mr. Willard was a judge in the\nPhilippines for a number of years, and\nis a personal friend of the President, who\nknows him to be well qualified for a\nplace on the bench. Senator Nelson\nwho is a member of the judiciary com-\nmittee, is evidently opposed to Mr. Wil-\nlard, as he was to Mr. Purdy, or the\nPresident would not have conferred with\nmembers of the judiciary committee about\nthe matter. \n",

The great bronze\nfigure representing the poet, seated, and\nwith a book in his hand, is placed upon a\nblock of Bonacord granite, brought from\nSweden and carved in Scotland. The fig-\nure of the poet is the work of an Amer-\nican sculptor, William Couper of New\nYork city. The statue is on the little tri-\nangle of grass at Connecticut avenue,\n18th street and M street. The exercises\nbegan at 2:30 o'clock.\nA grandchild of the poet pulled the\nsilken cord which broke loose the enfold-\ning flags, revealing the monument. As\nthe flags floated upward and remained\nsuspended in the air and the wonderful\nface of Longfellow, carved in bronze, was\nrevealed, the great throng was silent for\na moment and then broke into a spon-\ntaneous cheer. It was the climax of a\ngreat labor, occupying twelve years for\nits completion, and represented the con-\ntributions of thousands upon thousands\nof persons, from cities and hamlets\nthroughout the whole broad land.\nThe nation did honor to the poet whose\nworks, translated into nearly every\nmodern language, have sung the beau-\nties of American life, have told in most\nbeautiful word pictures of the distinctly\nAmerican features of the birth and up-\nbringing of the states of America. And\nas the nation has contributed its mites\nas well as its greater sums toward the\ncompletion of the statue, so were there\npresent men who represent the national\ngovernment and men and women who as\nprivate citizens stand for the highest\nideals in the communities of which they\nare part. The list of those who faced the\nstatue at its unveiling contains the names\nof ambassadors of great foreign nations,\nlawmakers and judges, and chief among\nthese was Melville Weston Fuller, chief\njustice of the Supreme Court. He pre-\nsided over the ceremonies.\nPresident Unable to Attend.\nPresident Taft was compelled today\nto abandon the idea of attending the\nunveiling, owing to a badly inflamed eye,\nover which he is wearing a light ban-\ndage. A gnat or some other small in-\nsect flew into Mr. Taft's eye while he\nwas horseback riding Wednesday after-\nnoon. The President gave little atten-\ntion to the matter at the time, but yes-\nterday his eye was much irritated. His\nphysician thought that the glare of the\nbright sunlight today would be bad for\nthe eye, and advised him not to venture\nout. Attorney General Wickersham, act-\ning for the President, accepted the gift\non behalf of the nation.\nOthers present were representatives\nfrom the courts of Europe and the gov-\nernments of American republics, citizens\nof Washington whose names are con-\nnected with every great event of the\ncapital, and visitors whom any city would\nbe proud to entertain.\nDescendants of the Poet Present.\nNot the least interesting feature of the\nunveiling was the presence of many of\nthe descendants of the poet. Not every\nliving descendant was present today, but\nmore than enough to fully represent the\nfamily of the man whose memory was\nhonored. They were:\nMrs. R. H. Dana, daughter; Mrs. H. C.\nleRham, second, granddaughter; R. H.\nDana, jr., grandson; H. E. L. Dana,\ngrandson; Miss Delia F. Dana, grand-\ndaughter; the Misses Thorp, granddaugh-\nters; Miss M. K. Longfellow, niece; Mrs.\nF. R. Barrett, niece; Miss E. T. Long-\nfellow, niece; Mrs. M. L. O'Donoghue,\nniece; Mrs. Paul Scharf, grandniece.\nThe program of music and addresses,\nopened as it was by an invocation from\nthe lips of Rev. Dr. Charles Wood and\nclosed with a simple sentence of prayer\nspoken by Rev. U. G. B. Pierce, was in\nitself a tribute to Longfellow. Every\nword, every thought, and it seemed as if\neach note of music had for its theme the\npoet who probably every one who heard\nand saw what went on in that little tri-\nangle of grass today declares the great-\nest singer that America has for its own.\nHad there been no statue, and if the\nwords spoken today should be printed,\nthe tribute might be called a complete\none, and the nation of the future might\nlook to the spoken tribute of today as\nthe complete praise for the author of\n\"Evangeline.\"\nThe Marine Band played \"America\" and\nopened the ceremonies, and when the last\nsound had died Dr. Wood asked God's\nblessing upon the day.\nRt. Rev. Dr. Alexander Mackay-Smith,\nonce of Washington and now Bishop Co-\ndjutor of Pennsylvania, was the first\nspeaker. It was in his house that the\nfirst meeting in Washington was held at\nwhich the possibility of erecting a statue\no the poet was discussed. From that\nmeeting grew the movement which swept\nhe country and gained friends and pop-\nularity everywhere and resulted in the\nrection of the monument. So it was Dr.\nMackay-Smith who was asked to recount\n",
